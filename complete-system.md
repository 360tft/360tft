                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely! The system is designed to work whether you're a complete beginner or experienced coach. Each session includes detailed coaching points, common mistakes to watch for, and progression options. Many parent coaches use this as their complete coaching education.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Free content gives you isolated drills. This gives you a complete system. Every session builds on the previous one, following the 360TFT Game Model progression. You get the 'why' behind every exercise, not just the 'what'. Plus lifetime community support from Kevin and {{ site.site_constants.coaches_mentored }} other coaches.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Most sessions use basic equipment: balls, cones, bibs. We always provide alternatives if you don't have specific items. The grassroots section specifically addresses coaching with minimal equipment.</p>
