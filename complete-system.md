faq_title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
faq_subtitle: "Everything you need to know before you start your coaching transformation"
faqs:
  - question: "Is this suitable for beginner coaches?"
    answer: "Absolutely! The system is designed to work whether you're a complete beginner or experienced coach. Each session includes detailed coaching points, common mistakes to watch for, and progression options. Many parent coaches use this as their complete coaching education."
  
  - question: "What age groups are covered?"
    answer: "The {{ site.site_constants.sessions_created }} sessions cover U8 through adult football. Each session can be adapted for different skill levels, and we provide specific guidance on age-appropriate expectations and modifications."
  
  - question: "How is this different from free content online?"
    answer: "Free content gives you isolated drills. This gives you a complete system. Every session builds on the previous one, following the 360TFT Game Model progression. You get the 'why' behind every exercise, not just the 'what'. Plus lifetime community support from Kevin and {{ site.site_constants.coaches_mentored }} other coaches."
  
  - question: "What equipment do I need?"
    answer: "Most sessions use basic equipment: balls, cones, bibs. We always provide alternatives if you don't have specific items. The grassroots section specifically addresses coaching with minimal equipment."
  
  - question: "Is there ongoing support?"
    answer: "Yes! Lifetime access to our private community where Kevin answers questions regularly. Plus updates to the content as the game evolves. You're not buying a static product - you're joining a coaching education system."
  
  - question: "What if it doesn't work for my team?"
    answer: "We offer a {{ site.guarantee.standard }}. If you implement the sessions and don't see improvement in your players' engagement and development, we'll refund every penny. No questions asked."
