  title: "Emotional Connection"
  principle: "Players don't remember what you taught them - they remember how you made them feel while they were learning it."
  explanation: "This changed everything about how I approach coaching interactions. The emotional state during learning determines retention and application."

- icon: "🧠"
  title: "Decision Making First"
  principle: "Technique without decision-making is just juggling."
  explanation: "Technical ability means nothing if players can't apply it under pressure, in the right moment, with teammates and opponents around them."

- icon: "📈"
  title: "Systematic Development"
  principle: "Every session must build on the last one."
  explanation: "Random training sessions create random players. Systematic development creates consistent improvement and confident decision-makers."

  title: "Independent Thinkers"
  principle: "The best coaches make themselves obsolete."
  explanation: "My job isn't to create players who depend on me for answers - it's to create players who can solve problems independently on the pitch."
