  title: "Emotional-Technical Integration"
  principle: "Players don't remember what you taught them - they remember how you made them feel while they were learning it."
  explanation: "This 360TFT principle drives our coaching language and session design. The emotional state during learning determines both technical retention and game application - that's why our methodology emphasizes confidence-building progressions."

  title: "360TFT Decision-Making Priority"
  principle: "Technique without decision-making is just juggling."
  explanation: "This drives the 360TFT Moment-Slice-Situation framework. Technical ability means nothing if players can't apply it under pressure. That's why every skill is taught within game-realistic contexts from the beginning."

  title: "360TFT Progressive Methodology"
  principle: "Every session must build on the last one."
  explanation: "This is the core of 360TFT's 16-week progressive blocks. Random training sessions create random players. The 360TFT systematic approach creates consistent improvement through measurable progressions and confident decision-makers."

  title: "360TFT Autonomous Player Development"
  principle: "The best coaches make themselves obsolete."
  explanation: "The 360TFT methodology develops independent problem-solvers. Rather than creating players who depend on coaching instruction, our systematic approach builds players who can analyze game moments and execute appropriate solutions autonomously."
