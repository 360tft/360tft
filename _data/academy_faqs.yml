# Common questions about Academy membership

- question: "What exactly do I get with Academy membership?"
  answer: "Monthly live masterclasses with Kevin Middleton, access to our private community of 500+ elite coaches, exclusive resources library, direct mentorship opportunities, and networking with coaches from professional academies worldwide. Everything is designed for serious coaches who want systematic improvement."

- question: "How is this different from the free community?"
  answer: "The free community is open to all coaches and focuses on basic Q&A and general discussions. The Academy is exclusively for committed coaches and includes live masterclasses, advanced resources, direct access to Kevin, career guidance, and connections with professional club coaches."

- question: "Can I cancel anytime?"
  answer: "Absolutely. There are no long-term contracts. You can cancel your membership at any time and retain access until your current billing period ends. We believe in earning your membership every month through value, not contracts."

- question: "Is the 7-day free trial really free?"
  answer: "Yes, completely free. You get full access to everything for 7 days with no payment required upfront. If you decide to continue after the trial, your membership begins. If not, simply cancel before the trial ends."

- question: "What if I'm just starting as a coach?"
  answer: "While the Academy is designed for serious coaches, we welcome ambitious beginners who are committed to excellence. The personalized development paths help new coaches accelerate their learning curve significantly."

- question: "How much time commitment is required?"
  answer: "The monthly masterclass is 90 minutes, plus whatever time you choose to spend in the community and implementing what you learn. Most members spend 2-4 hours per month actively engaging, but you can participate as much or as little as your schedule allows."

- question: "Are the masterclasses recorded if I can't attend live?"
  answer: "Yes, every masterclass is recorded and available in the members' library within 24 hours. You also get downloadable resources and implementation guides. However, live attendance is recommended for the Q&A sessions."

- question: "What level of coaches are in the Academy?"
  answer: "Our members range from ambitious grassroots coaches to professionals at Premier League academies. The diversity of experience levels creates rich learning opportunities and networking possibilities for everyone."

- question: "Will this help me advance my coaching career?"
  answer: "Many members have advanced their careers through Academy connections, improved coaching skills, and the confidence that comes from systematic development. While we can't guarantee career outcomes, the tools and network significantly increase your opportunities."

- question: "Is there a limit on Academy membership?"
  answer: "Yes, we maintain exclusivity by limiting membership to ensure quality interactions and personalized attention. New spots are released monthly as space becomes available."
