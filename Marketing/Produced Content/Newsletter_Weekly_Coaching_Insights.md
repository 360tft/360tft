### This Week's Focus: Why Your Players Struggle with Decision-Making (And the 3-Step Fix)

You've seen it countless times.

Your midfielder receives the ball in space, has three passing options, and... freezes. Ball lost. Opportunity wasted. Frustration mounts.

The problem isn't technical ability. It's decision-making under pressure.

After working with over 1,000 players, I've identified why this happens and exactly how to fix it.

**The Decision-Making Dilemma Explained**

Most training focuses on WHAT to do (pass, shoot, dribble) but ignores WHEN and WHY these decisions make sense.

Players practise passing accuracy in isolation but never experience choosing between passing and other options under time pressure. They develop technique without context.

When match situations demand split-second choices, they default to panic or hesitation because they've never practised the decision-making process systematically.

**The 360TFT 3-Step Decision-Making Fix**

**Step 1: Recognition Training**
Before players can make good decisions, they must recognise decision-making moments.

Simple activity: 3v2 possession with specific constraints
- Players get bonus points for identifying WHY they chose pass/dribble/shot
- Coach freezes play to highlight decision moments
- Focus on scanning before receiving the ball

Duration: 15 minutes maximum to maintain intensity

**Step 2: Options Practice**  
Present players with multiple viable choices and let them experience consequences.

Activity: 4v4+2 with multiple goals
- Players can score in any of 4 small goals
- Success requires reading which goal is most available
- Defenders must make choices about which goal to protect

This creates natural decision-making repetition without instruction overload.

**Step 3: Pressure Progression**
Gradually increase time and spatial pressure whilst maintaining decision-making focus.

Week 1: Decisions with time (no immediate pressure)
Week 2: Decisions with space constraints (smaller areas)  
Week 3: Decisions with opponent pressure (active defending)
Week 4: Match application (full game with decision-making emphasis)

**Implementation Notes**
- Start each session with 5 minutes of recognition training
- Use questioning rather than telling ("What did you see?" not "You should have passed")
- Celebrate good decisions regardless of technical execution
- Track decision-making improvements separately from technical skills

This systematic approach develops football intelligence alongside technical ability, creating players who think as well as they execute.

## Learning Corner Section

### ðŸ§  Coaching Insight of the Week

**Quote**: "Players don't lack ability. They lack experience making decisions under pressure." - Kevin Middleton

**Application**: Every activity should include decision-making opportunities. If players can predict what they'll do before receiving the ball, you're not developing game intelligence.

**This Week's Focus**: Add one decision-making element to your most common drill.
