The solutions might surprise you... üëá

**Tweet 2 (Problem #1)**
‚ùå PROBLEM #1: "My players can do it in training but freeze in matches"

This happens because you're practising skills in isolation.

‚úÖ THE FIX: Add pressure and decision-making to every drill.

Example: Instead of shooting at empty goals, add a keeper + time pressure.

**Tweet 3 (Problem #2)**  
‚ùå PROBLEM #2: "They keep using their strong foot only"

Forcing weak foot usage creates mechanical players who panic under pressure.

‚úÖ THE FIX: Create situations where weak foot is the BETTER option.

Place targets that naturally encourage both feet.

‚ùå PROBLEM #3: "Sunday night session planning panic"

Searching Google for random drills every week builds nothing.

‚úÖ THE FIX: Plan in 4-week development blocks.

Week 1: Introduction
Week 2: Development  
Week 3: Application
Week 4: Assessment

**Tweet 5 (Problem #4)**
‚ùå PROBLEM #4: "Players bunch up like magnets"

This happens when they don't understand WHY spacing matters.

‚úÖ THE FIX: Use small-sided games that REWARD width and depth.

Example: Extra points for goals scored from wide positions.

‚ùå PROBLEM #5: "I run out of ideas and repeat the same sessions"

Repetition without progression kills player development.

‚úÖ THE FIX: Build a session bank organised by development objective, not random themes.

Technical ‚Üí Tactical ‚Üí Physical ‚Üí Mental progression.
