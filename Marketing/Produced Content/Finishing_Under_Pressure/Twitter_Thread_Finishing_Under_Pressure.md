**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
ðŸ§µ THREAD: Something I've noticed with strikers over the years

They can hit the target consistently in training, but when the match arrives and there's pressure from defenders and keepers, sometimes that composure changes.

Here's what I've learned about helping them bridge that gap... ðŸ‘‡

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem Setup)**
I used to run finishing sessions where players had:

â€¢ All the time they needed to set up their shot
â€¢ Perfect ball deliveries from exactly where they wanted
â€¢ No defenders or pressure from keepers
â€¢ Multiple attempts until they got it right

But matches are very different.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Reality)**
In matches, strikers face:

â€¢ Defenders closing them down quickly
â€¢ Keepers coming off their line
â€¢ Balls arriving at awkward heights and speeds
â€¢ Limited time to think and compose themselves
â€¢ Pressure knowing chances might be limited

Different challenges need different preparation.

---

**Tweet 4 (Solution Introduction)**
What I've found helpful is gradually introducing match-like pressure into finishing practice:

â€¢ Start with time challenges (shot within 3 seconds)
â€¢ Add passive pressure (defender shadowing)
â€¢ Include keeper reactions
â€¢ Practice with different ball deliveries

Build pressure progressively.

---

**Tweet 5 (Progressive Approach)**
How I like to build this:

Week 1: Timed finishing (builds urgency without stress)
Week 2: Add passive defender (presence but no tackling)
Week 3: Light defensive pressure (can block shots)
Week 4: Full match-like scenarios

Gradual progression helps confidence develop.

---

**Tweet 6 (Match-Like Elements)**
To make it more match-realistic:

â€¢ Keepers actively trying to save shots
â€¢ Finishing from crosses and through balls (not just lay-offs)
â€¢ Second ball opportunities in the box
â€¢ Finishing when off-balance or under physical pressure
â€¢ Different angles and distances

Variety prepares them for anything.

---

**Tweet 7 (Age Considerations)**
For different ages:

Younger players (U10-12): Focus on technique first, add gentle time pressure
Middle ages (U13-15): Include light defensive pressure and keeper reactions
Older players (U16+): Full match-realistic scenarios with physical pressure

Match challenge to development stage.

---

**Tweet 8 (Common Observations)**
What I notice when players aren't used to pressure:

â€¢ They rush their shots when defenders arrive
â€¢ First touch gets heavy under pressure
â€¢ They avoid shooting when there's a better chance available
â€¢ They get frustrated after one miss

Practice under pressure helps with all of these.

---

**Tweet 9 (Implementation Tips)**
Some practical ideas to try:

â€¢ "Beat the clock" finishing challenges
â€¢ Partner shooting where one feeds, one pressures
â€¢ Small-sided games where goals only count from certain areas
â€¢ Finishing circuits with different types of pressure

Keep it varied and progressive.

---

**Tweet 10 (Key Points)**
What to emphasize:

â€¢ First touch that sets up the shot quickly
â€¢ Body shape that allows shooting with either foot
â€¢ Quick decision-making (shoot, pass, or take another touch)
â€¢ Staying composed after missed chances

Technique under pressure takes practice.

**Tweet 11 (Results)**
Coaches who try this approach often notice:

"My striker started taking shots earlier in matches instead of waiting for the perfect moment"

"Our finishing improved because players were more comfortable when defenders arrived"

It's about transferring skills from practice to games.

---

**Tweet 12 (Call to Action)**
If you'd like to try this approach:

This week, add one pressure element to your finishing practice:
â€¢ Time limit on shots
â€¢ Passive defender presence
â€¢ Keeper actively trying to save
â€¢ Different ball deliveries

See how players respond and adjust accordingly.
