**Option 1 (Reframe-focused):**

**Option 2 (Problem-solution):**
Matchday warmups shouldn't just get players warm.

They should:
🔄 Rehearse habits
🎯 Build clarity  
⚡ Set the tone
📋 Reduce chaos

Match tempo starts before kickoff.

**Option 3 (Results-focused):**
The difference between good and great warmups:

❌ Generic jogging and stretching
✅ Game-specific movement patterns
❌ Random ball work
✅ Tactical rehearsal
❌ Individual preparation
✅ Collective activation
