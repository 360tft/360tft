"Everything that goes on in a match, you can do in a rondo" - Laureano Ruiz

Rondo hack: The Switching Rondo

7v2 circle + 4 small gates outside
Maintain possession while looking for gate opportunities

Teaches timing of penetrating passes vs safe possession.
Patience with purpose.

**Story Tweet:**
Watched a coach run "perfect" 7v2 circles for 20 minutes yesterday.

Players were technically solid but mentally switched off.

Same structure, different constraints = completely different learning outcomes.

How many of your players can dominate rondos but disappear in games?

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

**LinkedIn Version:**
Rondo methodology in youth development:

Traditional approach: Technical repetition in circular formations
Progressive approach: Problem-solving through constrained environments

Key differentiator: Educational rondos present game-realistic challenges that develop decision-making under pressure.

Implementation requires shifting focus from ball circulation to intelligent ball circulation.
