# COACHING SPOTLIGHT: Rondo Intelligence vs Rondo Recreation

## The Weekly Challenge

Your players can maintain possession beautifully in 7v2 circles but struggle to recognise when to penetrate in actual games. The issue? We're running rondos, not coaching them.

## This Week's Game-Changer: Educational Rondos

**The Problem:** Most rondos focus on keeping the ball moving without specific learning objectives.

**The Solution:** Create problems within the rondo structure that mirror game situations:
- When to be patient vs when to penetrate
- How to switch play under pressure  
- Recognising numerical advantages
- Transitioning between game phases

## Quick Implementation: The Switching Rondo

**Setup:** 7v2 circle + 4 small gates outside the circle
**Objective:** Maintain possession while looking for opportunities to pass through gates
**Learning:** Teaches timing of penetrating passes vs safe possession

## Success Indicators

Watch for these behavioural changes:
- Consistent scanning before receiving the ball
- Creative support movement that adapts to game flow
- Quicker decision-making under pressure
- Players finding unexpected but effective solutions

## Community Spotlight

"Replaced our warm-up passing circle with the Switching Rondo. The change in player attention and decision-making was immediate. They went from autopilot passing to actively reading the game." - Sarah M., U14 Coach

## This Week's Challenge

Try the **Transition Rondo**:
- 6v3 in square with small goals at opposite ends
- Achieve 6 passes then attack either goal
- Watch how players learn to switch between possession and penetration mindsets
