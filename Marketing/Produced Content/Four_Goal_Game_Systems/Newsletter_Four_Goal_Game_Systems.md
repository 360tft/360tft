# COACHING SPOTLIGHT: Four-Goal Game Decision-Making

## The Weekly Challenge

Traditional 2-goal games create predictable attacking patterns. Players learn to attack one direction, defend one goal. Four-goal games force continuous decision-making and create the chaos that mirrors real football.

## This Week's Game-Changer: Multiple Decision Points

**The Problem:** Simple setups don't develop game intelligence.

**The Solution:** Four-goal games create:
- Multiple attacking opportunities simultaneously
- Continuous scanning and assessment needs
- Defensive challenges from multiple directions
- Transitional thinking between opportunities

## Quick Implementation: Basic Four-Goal Setup

**Setup:** Two teams, four small goals positioned around the playing area
**Rule:** Teams can score in any of the opposition's goals
**Progression:** Add constraints like specific start positions or numerical changes

## Success Indicators

Watch for:
- Increased scanning behaviour before receiving the ball
- Quicker recognition of best attacking opportunities  
- Better transitional play when first option disappears
- Improved defensive awareness of multiple threats

## Community Spotlight

"Introduced 4-goal games last month. The improvement in scanning and decision-making has been remarkable. Players are thinking two moves ahead instead of just reacting." - James P., Academy Coach

## This Week's Challenge

Replace one traditional 2v2 or 3v3 game with a **Four-Goal Game**:
- Position goals at different distances and angles
- Allow teams to score in any opposition goal
- Watch how decision-making complexity increases
- Note the improvement in game intelligence

## Advanced Applications

- **Numerical variations:** Start 4v4, add players on successful scores
- **Time constraints:** Goals are only "active" for certain periods
- **Zone restrictions:** Certain goals can only be attacked from specific areas
