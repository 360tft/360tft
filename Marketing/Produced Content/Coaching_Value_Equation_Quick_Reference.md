# Coaching Value Equation Quick Reference Guide

## Immediate Implementation Checklist for 360TFT Content

### Before Publishing Any Content, Ask:

#### 1. DREAM OUTCOME (Does this promise player transformation?)
- [ ] **Headline leads with player transformation** (not coaching features)
- [ ] **Specific timeline included** ("8 weeks", "first session", "by Friday")
- [ ] **Identity change suggested** ("become the coach players remember")
- [ ] **Before/after progression clear** (average players → match winners)

**Quick Test**: If you removed "coaching" from the content, would it still make sense? If yes, you're focusing on transformation, not features.

#### 2. PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD (Will coaches believe it works?)
- [ ] **Specific proof numbers** ("327 coaches", "16 weeks to ball mastery")
- [ ] **"Why This Works" section included** (addresses previous disappointments)
- [ ] **Kevin's authority referenced** ("15 years", "1000+ players")
- [ ] **Testimonial placed at doubt moment** (when coaches think "this won't work for me")

**Quick Test**: Would a skeptical coach reading this think "that could actually work for my players"?

#### 3. TIME DELAY (Can coaches use this tonight?)
- [ ] **"Tonight's training" language** (not "improve over time")
- [ ] **"First session results" promised** (not "eventually")
- [ ] **Progressive timeline mapped** (Session 1, Week 2, Month 1)
- [ ] **Immediate access emphasised** (not just "instant download")

**Quick Test**: Could a coach implement this before their next training session?

#### 4. EFFORT & SACRIFICE (Does this feel easy?)
- [ ] **Maximum 3 steps to implement** (Download → Setup → Transform)
- [ ] **Visual over text explanations** (GIFs, not paragraphs)
- [ ] **One-click access available** (mobile-optimised)
- [ ] **Common mistakes prevented** (foolproof instructions)

**Quick Test**: Would a busy coach think "I can definitely do this"?
