The beauty of the V-cone system?

Simplicity creates consistency.
→ Quick setup (30 seconds max)
→ Works in any space  
→ Adapts to any skill level
→ Enables progressive difficulty

Equipment doesn't make the coach. Adaptability does.

Why the V-shape specifically?

✅ Creates natural movement angles
✅ Simulates match-realistic turns  
✅ Enables both left and right development
✅ Builds spatial awareness
✅ Encourages change of direction

Every touch has purpose.

The 8-exercise progression using this setup:

**Foundation Level:**
1. Inside Taps (between cones)
2. Inside/Outside (around each cone)  
3. Cruyff Turns (sharp direction changes)

Simple movements, maximum benefit.

**Tweet 5:**
**Intermediate Level:**
4. Ronaldo Chops (explosive direction change)
5. David Silva (outside turn + body feint)
6. Inside to Go Outside (combination sequence)

Each exercise builds on the previous one.

**Tweet 6:**
**Advanced Level:**
7. Change Lane (roll away from pressure)
8. Change Lane & Back (complex multi-directional)

By this stage, players are thinking 2-3 touches ahead.

Match-ready decision making.

The coaching keys:
→ Start slow, build speed gradually
→ Both feet, every exercise
→ Quality over quantity initially  
→ Add pressure when technique is solid
→ Connect every movement to match situations

Progression beats perfection.
