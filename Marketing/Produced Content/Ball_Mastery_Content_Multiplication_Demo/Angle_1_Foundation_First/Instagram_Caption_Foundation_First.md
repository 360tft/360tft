Stop teaching tactics to players who can't control the ball âš½

I see coaches trying to implement complex systems with 9-year-olds who panic every time they receive a pass.

You're building a house on sand.

Here's what 15+ years and 1,000+ players taught me:

**Ball mastery comes first. Always.**

Ages 6-12 are the sponge years. Players absorb skills faster than any other time in their development.

Miss this window, and you're playing catch-up forever.

**The foundation approach:**
â†’ 2 cones in a V-shape (that's it!)
â†’ 8 progressive exercises
â†’ From simple touches to complex combinations
â†’ Every exercise connects to match situations

**Results:**
âœ… Players who don't panic under pressure
âœ… Creative problem-solvers in tight spaces  
âœ… Skills that transfer to matches automatically
âœ… Higher confidence and enjoyment

Technical confidence creates tactical intelligence.

Build the foundation first. Everything else follows.
