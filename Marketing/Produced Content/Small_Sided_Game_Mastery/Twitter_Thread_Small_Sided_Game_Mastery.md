üßµ THREAD: Why your 7v7 games aren't developing players

After using small-sided games with 1,000+ players, most coaches choose formats based on available numbers rather than development objectives.

This wastes training time and limits learning... üëá

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem Setup)**
‚ùå THE PROBLEM: Format selection based on player count

Common logic:
‚Ä¢ 14 players = 7v7
‚Ä¢ 10 players = 5v5  
‚Ä¢ 8 players = 4v4

This treats games as time-fillers rather than development tools.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Reality)**
üéØ FORMAT-OBJECTIVE RELATIONSHIP:

3v3 = Maximum touches, basic decisions
5v5 = Tactical complexity, moderate touches
7v7 = Advanced tactics, fewer touches
9v9 = Match realism, minimal individual touches

Choosing wrong format = wasted development opportunity.

**Tweet 4 (Solution Introduction)**
‚úÖ THE 360TFT SOLUTION: Objective-led format selection

Start with development goal, work backwards to optimal format:

üíπ Technical focus ‚Üí 2v2/3v3 for max touches
üß† Tactical focus ‚Üí 6v6-8v8 for complexity
üí™ Physical focus ‚Üí 4v4/5v5 for work-rate balance

**Tweet 5 (Rule Modifications)**
üîß STEP 2: Strategic rule modifications

Standard rules don't always serve development:

‚Ä¢ Two-touch max for quick passing
‚Ä¢ Goals only from wide areas for width
‚Ä¢ Bonus points for consecutive passes
‚Ä¢ No backpasses for forward thinking

---

**Tweet 6 (Progressive Complexity)**
üìà STEP 3: Progressive complexity

Week 1: Basic format, simple rules
Week 2: Add tactical constraints  
Week 3: Increase complexity
Week 4: Match application

Systematic development, not random games.

---

**Tweet 7 (Age Applications)**
üë∂ AGE-APPROPRIATE APPLICATIONS:

U8-10: 3v3-4v4 max, simple rules, 8-12 min
U11-14: 5v5-7v7 with position constraints
U15+: 8v8-9v9 with match complexity

Format must match developmental capability.

---

**Tweet 8 (Common Mistakes)**
üö´ AVOID THESE MISTAKES:

‚Ä¢ Choosing format based on available players
‚Ä¢ Same rules throughout session
‚Ä¢ Ignoring space dimensions
‚Ä¢ Running games until fatigue

Purposeful design beats random selection every time.

---

**Tweet 9 (Academy Insight)**
üèÜ WHAT ACADEMIES KNOW:

Professional academies design games around development objectives, not player numbers.

They understand format-objective relationships and use games as sophisticated development tools.

Not time-fillers.

**Tweet 10 (Implementation)**
üîÑ THIS WEEK'S TRANSFORMATION:

Before next session:
1. Identify primary development objective
2. Select format that serves this objective
3. Modify rules for accelerated learning
4. Adjust rotation as needed
