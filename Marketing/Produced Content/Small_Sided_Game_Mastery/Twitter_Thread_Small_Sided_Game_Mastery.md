ðŸ§µ THREAD: Something I've learned about small-sided games over the years

The format you choose makes a huge difference to what players actually learn and experience.

Here's how I think about selecting the right format for different objectives... ðŸ‘‡

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem Setup)**
I used to choose formats based purely on numbers:

â€¢ 14 players arrived = 7v7
â€¢ 10 players showed up = 5v5  
â€¢ 8 players came = 4v4

But I started noticing different formats create very different learning experiences for players.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Reality)**
What I've observed:

3v3 = Lots of ball contact, simpler decisions
5v5 = Balanced touches and tactical choices
7v7 = More complex tactics, fewer individual touches
9v9 = Closer to match conditions

Each format teaches different things.

---

**Tweet 4 (Solution Introduction)**
Now I try to start with what I want players to work on:

For technical development â†’ smaller numbers (2v2/3v3) mean more touches
For tactical understanding â†’ larger formats (6v6-8v8) create more complex decisions
For fitness and intensity â†’ mid-range numbers (4v4/5v5) provide good balance

**Tweet 5 (Rule Modifications)**
Sometimes I'll adjust rules to encourage specific behaviors:

â€¢ Two-touch limit helps players think faster
â€¢ Goals from wide areas encourages width
â€¢ Extra points for consecutive passes rewards teamwork
â€¢ Must use both feet develops weaker side

Small changes can guide learning.

**Tweet 6 (Progressive Complexity)**
I like to build complexity gradually:

Week 1: Learn the basic format and rules
Week 2: Add one tactical element  
Week 3: Increase challenge or space
Week 4: Let them play with everything they've learned

This gives players time to adapt and improve.

**Tweet 7 (Age Applications)**
Different ages handle different complexities:

U8-10: 3v3 or 4v4 works well, keep rules simple, shorter games
U11-14: 5v5 to 7v7 with some tactical elements
U15+: Can handle larger formats and more complex rules

Match the challenge to where they are developmentally.

---

**Tweet 8 (Common Mistakes)**
What I've learned to watch for:

â€¢ Just picking based on who shows up
â€¢ Never changing rules or format during session
â€¢ Using spaces that are too big or too small
â€¢ Running games too long and losing quality

Taking time to think about format choice really helps.

**Tweet 9 (Academy Insight)**
What I've noticed from working with different programs:

The most effective coaches think carefully about format selection.

They see small-sided games as learning opportunities, not just ways to keep players busy.

This intentional approach makes a real difference.

**Tweet 10 (Implementation)**
If you'd like to try this approach:

Before your next session:
1. Think about what you want players to work on
2. Choose a format that supports that objective
3. Consider if any rule changes would help
4. Be ready to adjust if needed during the session

---

**Tweet 11 (Results)**
Coaches who try this often notice:

"My players started improving faster when I matched formats to what we were working on"

"The games felt more purposeful and players stayed more engaged"

It's a simple shift that can make training more effective.
