**Subject**: Why your 7v7 games aren't developing players

Hi [First Name],

It's session planning time. You count players: 14 available.

"Right, 7v7 it is."

Sound familiar?

After using small-sided games with over 1,000 players across 15+ years, I've identified why this approach limits player development and wastes precious training time.

The problem isn't your game choice. It's your selection method.

**The Numbers Game Fallacy**

Most coaches choose small-sided game formats based on available players rather than development objectives.

14 players = 7v7
10 players = 5v5
8 players = 4v4

This treats small-sided games as time-fillers rather than the powerful development tools they should be.

Result? Players participate in games that may or may not address their development needs. Training time gets wasted on activities that don't serve clear learning objectives.

**The Development Reality Check**

Different formats serve different development purposes:

üéØ **3v3 = Maximum touches, basic decisions**
üéØ **5v5 = Tactical complexity, moderate touches**
üéØ **7v7 = Advanced tactics, fewer individual touches**
üéØ **9v9 = Match realism, minimal touch frequency**

Choosing format without considering this trade-off misses targeted development opportunities.

**The 360TFT Systematic Solution**

Instead of format selection based on numbers, the 360TFT methodology starts with development objectives and works backwards to optimal game design.

Here's the 3-step system that transforms random games into purposeful development tools:

**Step 1: Objective-Led Format Selection**
Technical development? ‚Üí 2v2 or 3v3 for maximum touches
Tactical development? ‚Üí 6v6 to 8v8 for complexity without chaos
Physical development? ‚Üí 4v4 to 5v5 for work-rate balance

**Step 2: Strategic Rule Modification**
Standard rules don't always serve development objectives.

Examples:
‚Ä¢ Two-touch maximum for quick passing development
‚Ä¢ Goals only from wide areas for width creation
‚Ä¢ Bonus points for consecutive passes for possession
‚Ä¢ No backpasses for forward-thinking development

**Step 3: Progressive Complexity**
Week 1: Basic format, simple rules
Week 2: Add tactical constraints
Week 3: Increase complexity
Week 4: Match application

**What Academy Coaches Know (That Grassroots Coaches Miss)**

Professional academies design small-sided games around development objectives, not available players. They understand format-objective relationships and use games as sophisticated development tools.

The Football Coaching Academy brings this systematic approach to grassroots coaching through:

‚úÖ **Progressive Game Libraries** organised by development objective
‚úÖ **Format Selection Guidelines** for every age group and focus
‚úÖ **Rule Modification Templates** that accelerate specific learning
‚úÖ **Assessment Tools** for measuring game-based development

**Real Results from Real Coaches**

*"Stopped choosing formats based on numbers and started with objectives. Player development accelerated dramatically - they're getting exactly what they need from games now."* - Sarah from Newcastle

*"Applied the systematic game design approach. Parents immediately noticed improvement in match performance because training games actually prepared players for real situations."* - Mark from Cardiff

*"The rule modification templates transformed boring possession games into engaging development activities. Players love the variety and learning outcomes are measurable."* - Lisa from Brighton

**Common Format Selection Mistakes to Avoid**

‚ùå Choosing format based on available players
‚ùå Using identical rules throughout entire session
‚ùå Ignoring space dimensions for development objectives
‚ùå Running games until players tire rather than optimising duration

**Age-Appropriate Applications**

**U8-10:** 3v3 to 4v4 maximum, simple rules, 8-12 minute durations
**U11-14:** 5v5 to 7v7 with position-specific constraints
**U15+:** 8v8 to 9v9 with match-realistic complexity

**This Week's Game Revolution**

Before your next session:

1. Identify your primary development objective
2. Select format that serves this objective (ignore player numbers)
3. Modify rules to accelerate specific learning
4. Adjust player rotation or create multiple games as needed

Notice the immediate difference in player engagement and development outcomes.
