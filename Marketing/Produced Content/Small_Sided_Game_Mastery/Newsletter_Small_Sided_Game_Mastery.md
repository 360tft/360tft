### This Week's Focus: Why Your 7v7 Games Aren't Developing Players (And the 3-Step Fix)

Session planning time. You count available players: 14.

"Right, 7v7 it is."

This decision process, repeated by thousands of coaches every week, treats small-sided games as time-fillers rather than the sophisticated development tools they should be.

After using small-sided games with over 1,000 players across 15+ years, I've identified why format selection based on available numbers limits player development and how systematic game design accelerates learning.

The solution isn't more variety. It's purposeful design.

**The Numbers Game Fallacy**

Most coaches operate with simple mathematics:
- 14 players = 7v7
- 10 players = 5v5  
- 8 players = 4v4

This approach ignores the fundamental reality that different formats serve different development purposes. Players participate in games that may or may not address their current development needs.

The result? Wasted training time on activities that don't serve clear learning objectives.

**The Format-Development Relationship**

Every small-sided game format creates specific development opportunities:

**3v3 Games:** Maximum touches per player, basic decision-making, high intensity
**5v5 Games:** Tactical complexity with manageable choices, moderate touch frequency
**7v7 Games:** Advanced tactical understanding required, fewer individual touches
**9v9 Games:** Near match-realistic complexity, minimal touch repetition

Choosing format without considering this relationship misses targeted development opportunities and may overwhelm or under-challenge players.

**The 360TFT Systematic Game Design Approach**

Effective small-sided game selection starts with development objectives and works backwards to optimal format, rules, and space dimensions.

**Step 1: Objective-Led Format Selection**

*Technical Development Priority:* Use 2v2 or 3v3 formats that maximise touches and technique repetition under pressure

*Tactical Development Priority:* Choose 6v6 to 8v8 formats that provide complexity whilst maintaining individual engagement

*Physical Development Priority:* Select 4v4 to 5v5 formats that balance work rate with recovery opportunities

The format serves the objective, not the available numbers.

**Step 2: Strategic Rule Modification for Learning Enhancement**

Standard football rules don't always serve specific development objectives. Strategic modifications accelerate targeted learning.

*Examples of Developmental Rule Changes:*
- Two-touch maximum for quick decision-making development
- Goals only count from wide areas for natural width creation
- Bonus points for consecutive passes before goals for possession focus
- No backpasses allowed for forward-thinking development

Rules become learning accelerators rather than arbitrary restrictions.

**Step 3: Progressive Complexity Management**

Start with simplified versions that ensure early success, then systematically add complexity as competence develops.

*Weekly Progression Example:*
Week 1: Basic format with simple, clear rules
Week 2: Add one tactical constraint or objective
Week 3: Increase spatial, numerical, or temporal complexity
Week 4: Full match application of developed concepts

This ensures players master fundamentals before advanced concepts are introduced.

**Age-Appropriate Game Design Principles**

**Foundation Phase (U8-10):** Maximum 3v3 to 4v4 formats, simple rules that can be remembered without constant reminders, 8-12 minute durations to match attention spans

**Development Phase (U11-14):** 5v5 to 7v7 formats with position-specific constraints, progressive rule complexity throughout sessions

**Specialisation Phase (U15+):** 8v8 to 9v9 formats with match-realistic complexity, position-specific roles and responsibilities

Format sophistication must match cognitive and physical development stages.

**Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid**

*Mistake 1: Format Selection Based on Available Numbers*
Solution: Select format based on development objective, then adjust player rotation or create multiple concurrent games

*Mistake 2: Static Rules Throughout Session*
Solution: Progressive rule modifications that increase complexity as players demonstrate competence

*Mistake 3: Ignoring Space Dimensions*
Solution: Adjust space to match format and development focus - smaller for technique emphasis, larger for tactical development

*Mistake 4: Inconsistent Game Duration*
Solution: Plan duration based on development focus and maintain quality through appropriate work-rest ratios

## Quick Wins Section

### âš¡ This Week's Quick Win: The Format Revolution Formula

Transform any small-sided game from time-filler to development tool in 30 seconds.

**The Simple Process:**
1. **Identify** your primary development objective before counting players
2. **Select** format that serves this objective (ignore available numbers initially)
3. **Modify** one rule to accelerate specific learning
4. **Adjust** player rotation or create multiple games as needed

**Example Transformation:**
- **Before:** "We have 14 players, let's do 7v7"
- **After:** "We need technical development, so 3v3 rotation with two-touch rule"

**Immediate Benefits:**
- Players receive targeted development rather than random activity
- Training time serves clear learning objectives
- Engagement increases through purposeful game design
- Development outcomes become measurable and predictable

Simple implementation: Apply this formula to one game in your next session and observe the difference.
