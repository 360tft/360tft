**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
ðŸ§µ THREAD: Something I've learned about match day confidence over the years

Last-minute pep talks might get players excited, but real confidence comes from knowing you've prepared well and proven your abilities in practice.

Here's how I think about building genuine match confidence... ðŸ‘‡

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem Setup)**
I used to rely heavily on pre-match team talks to get players confident:

â€¢ "Believe in yourselves!"
â€¢ "You're better than them!"
â€¢ "Just go out and play!"

But I noticed this created temporary excitement that often faded when players faced real challenges in matches.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Reality)**
What I've learned about real confidence:

â€¢ It comes from having practiced skills under pressure successfully
â€¢ It's built through gradually increasing challenges in training
â€¢ It's strengthened when players overcome difficulties
â€¢ It's personal - what gives one player confidence might not work for another

Genuine confidence is earned through experience.

---

**Tweet 4 (Solution Introduction)**
What I've found helps build lasting confidence:

â€¢ Make sure players have solid technical skills they can rely on
â€¢ Practice those skills under gradually increasing pressure
â€¢ Help players develop personal pre-match routines that work for them
â€¢ Focus on what they can control rather than outcomes

Build from competence, not just words.

---

**Tweet 5 (Building Competence)**
First, help players develop skills they can trust:

â€¢ Practice technical skills until they become automatic
â€¢ Work on decision-making in game-like situations
â€¢ Build physical fitness appropriate to their role
â€¢ Practice recovering from mistakes and setbacks

Confidence grows when players know they can handle challenges.

**Tweet 6 (Adding Pressure Gradually)**
Then introduce pressure progressively:

â€¢ Start with low-pressure situations where success is likely
â€¢ Gradually increase challenge as confidence builds
â€¢ Practice skills in game-like scenarios
â€¢ Help players experience success under pressure in training

This transfers to match situations more effectively.

---

**Tweet 7 (Personal Preparation)**
Help players develop their own pre-match routines:

â€¢ Warm-up activities that remind them of their skills
â€¢ Technical practice focusing on their strengths
â€¢ Mental preparation that works for their personality
â€¢ Individual rituals that help them feel ready

Personal routines create familiarity and control.

**Tweet 8 (Age Considerations)**
Different ages need different approaches:

Younger players (U10-12): Focus on fun and skill mastery
Middle ages (U13-15): Practice handling pressure and mistakes
Older players (U16+): Individual preparation and mental strategies

Match the approach to their development stage.

---

**Tweet 9 (Common Mistakes)**
What I've learned to avoid:

â€¢ Trying to build confidence at the last minute
â€¢ Using the same approach for all players
â€¢ Making players dependent on external motivation
â€¢ Avoiding challenging situations to "protect" confidence

Real confidence comes from facing and overcoming challenges.

---

**Tweet 10 (Practical Application)**
How this looks in practice:

â€¢ Focus training on skills players will use in matches
â€¢ Practice scenarios they're likely to face
â€¢ Celebrate improvement, not just perfection
â€¢ Help players learn from mistakes rather than fear them

Make training relevant to match demands.

---

**Tweet 11 (Results)**
Coaches who try this approach often notice:

"My players started looking more relaxed before matches because they knew they were prepared"

"Match performance improved because players trusted their abilities"

Confidence built through preparation shows on match day.

This week, focus on:
â€¢ One skill each player can practice until they trust it
â€¢ Gradually adding pressure to familiar activities
