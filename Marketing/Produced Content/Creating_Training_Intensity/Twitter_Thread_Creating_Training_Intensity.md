# Twitter Thread: Creating Training Intensity

"Make it competitive!" Why this approach kills training motivation for half your players üßµ

After 15+ years developing training intensity with 1,000+ players, I've identified why forced competition creates anxiety and how systematic challenge builds genuine engagement for everyone.

The forced competition problem:

‚ùå Competitive pressure regardless of readiness
‚ùå Win-lose formats creating anxiety
‚ùå External pressure when intrinsic motivation works better
‚ùå Competition interfering with learning objectives

Some engage, others withdraw.

The reality of player motivation:

‚Ä¢ Individual challenge preferences vary dramatically
‚Ä¢ Some thrive on competition, others on mastery
‚Ä¢ Anxiety kills learning and skill development
‚Ä¢ Genuine intensity comes from appropriate challenge

Match method to motivation.

Position-specific intensity needs:

**Goalkeepers**: Shot-stopping challenges + leadership responsibility
**Defenders**: 1v1 contests + build-up pressure
**Midfielders**: Multi-phase intensity + decision-making speed
**Forwards**: Finishing pressure + creative expression

Match demands to position.

Age-appropriate intensity development:

**6-10 years**: Fun-based through games and exploration
**11-14 years**: Progressive challenge with cooperation
**15+ years**: Match-realistic with professional standards

Readiness guides intensity.

Common intensity mistakes:

‚ùå Forced competition without readiness check
‚ùå Intensity without learning objectives
‚ùå Generic methods for different motivations
‚ùå Inconsistent intensity standards

Systematic approach prevents these.

"Stopped forcing competition, started matching challenge to motivation. Every player engaged because they got appropriate intensity without anxiety." - Mark, Birmingham

The choice every coach faces:

Continue forcing competition that creates anxiety for some whilst motivating others...

Or develop systematic intensity that provides appropriate challenge for every player through individual motivation matching.

Which engages everyone?
