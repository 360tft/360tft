# Twitter Thread: Better 1v1 Sessions

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
Most 1v1 sessions stumble before they begin.

There are long lines, too many bored players, and too few reps.

Here are 3 ways to build better 1v1 sessions üßµ

**Tweet 2:**
The Problem:

16 players, 2 cones, 1 exercise = disaster

Each player gets action every 8 minutes
That's 7 meaningful touches in 60 minutes
14 players standing around, switching off

The mathematics are brutal. The psychology is worse.

**Tweet 3:**
Traditional thinking:
"We need to observe closely and provide feedback"

The result:
Most players become passive observers rather than active participants

Players need VOLUME before perfection
REPETITION before refinement
ENGAGEMENT before correction

**Tweet 4:**
Solution 1: Multiple Stations, Simultaneous Action

Instead of:
‚Ä¢ 1 station, 16 players
‚Ä¢ Action every 8 minutes

Create:
‚Ä¢ 4 stations, 4 players each  
‚Ä¢ Action every 2 minutes
‚Ä¢ 400% increase in engagement time

**Tweet 5:**
Solution 2: Progressive Challenges Within Stations

Every 3-4 minutes, evolve the challenge:

‚Ä¢ Basic 1v1 to goal
‚Ä¢ 1v1 with specific start positions
‚Ä¢ 1v1 in defined channels  
‚Ä¢ 1v1 with time pressure

Same exercise, different layers of complexity

**Tweet 6:**
Solution 3: Self-Sustaining Competition

Create formats that run themselves:

"King of the Station"
‚Ä¢ Winner stays on
‚Ä¢ Challenger rotates in
‚Ä¢ First to 3 wins = station champion

Natural intensity. No dead time. Player ownership.

**Tweet 7:**
What changes when you get this right:

‚ùå Players waiting for instruction
‚úÖ Players arriving at stations immediately

‚ùå Energy dropping mid-session  
‚úÖ Sustained competitive intensity

‚ùå Coach-dependent learning
‚úÖ Self-sustaining development

**Tweet 8:**
The behaviour changes are the real indicator:

‚Ä¢ Players coaching each other within stations
‚Ä¢ Natural competitive dialogue  
‚Ä¢ Energy levels staying high throughout
‚Ä¢ Players asking to continue when session ends

Technical improvement follows engagement.

**Tweet 9:**
Implementation timeline:

Week 1: Master multi-station structure
Week 2: Add simple progressions
Week 3: Introduce competition formats  
Week 4: Layer in game context

Don't try everything at once. Build complexity on reliable execution.

**Tweet 10:**
The transfer to match day:

Players with 30+ meaningful 1v1 reps per session approach game situations with familiarity, not fear.

They become decision-makers under pressure because they've PRACTISED decision-making under pressure.

**Tweet 11:**
Your role evolves:

From instructor ‚Üí facilitator
From information delivery ‚Üí environment creation
From passive recipients ‚Üí active learners

The mathematics are simple: more engagement = more learning.

**Tweet 12:**
Common mistake:

Trying to implement everything immediately

Start with structure. Add complexity gradually. Your players need time to adapt to higher engagement levels and increased responsibility for their learning.

Simple setups that run smoothly > complex setups that break down.

**Tweet 13:**
Quick question for grassroots coaches:

C) Providing individual feedback
D) Equipment limitations

The bottom line:

Most 1v1 sessions fail because of delivery, not content.

Fix the structure, and everything else becomes possible.
