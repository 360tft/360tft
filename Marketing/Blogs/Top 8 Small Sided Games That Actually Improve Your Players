If you’re reading this, there’s a good chance you already use small sided games (SSGs) in your sessions. But here’s the problem I see all the time – the format looks right, but the outcomes don’t land. The structure is sound, but the learning isn’t sticking. Players just run around. There’s no coaching moment. No game transfer.

This blog is about fixing that. I want to walk you through the 8 SSGs featured in my Small Sided Games Cheatsheet – why I chose them, how I’ve used them, and most importantly, what they teach your players. Each one is built with purpose, simplicity, and game realism in mind.

Why Small-Sided Games Work (When They’re Coached Properly)

SSGs give your players:





More touches per player



More repeated decisions



More realism and transition moments



Clear game-like consequences

But they only deliver if you coach the key moments. The best SSGs aren’t just about playing. They’re about solving – solving space, pressure, tempo, and movement. That’s what this cheatsheet is designed to highlight.

The 8 Games and Why They Matter

Let’s break them down. These aren’t just random games. They each link to specific problems or themes that players need to solve:

1. 1v1 to Goal – Dribbling and Finishing

One player attacks, one defends. There are two goals at either end. Players must beat the opponent and score. Simple format, high repetition. I’ve used this to sharpen finishing in tight spaces and help players get more confident attacking defenders directly.

2. 2v2+2 – Playing Off Movement

Two teams of two with two neutral players (one at each end). The focus here is on support play, angle of movement, and combination. This format is ideal for coaching players on how to use bounce passes, third-man runs, and timing their support.

3. 3v3+1 – Defensive Compactness and Pressing

Three versus three with a joker player who plays with whoever has the ball. The extra player gives the team in possession an advantage, and that forces the defending side to either press together or collapse space. I’ve used this to coach shifting, timing of pressure, and how to play out from overloads.

4. 4v4+2 – Switching the Point of Attack

Two neutral players act as bounce players on each side. The goal is to break pressure by playing through and around. This is brilliant for coaching width, switching play, and using the third man to escape tight areas.

5. 5v5+2 – Central Overload

One joker player in the middle acts as a pivot. Teams must play off this central point to link play. What I love about this one is it teaches players to recognise when to play into central zones and how to use a support player efficiently under pressure.

6. 6v6 – Finding Pockets in Tight Spaces

No jokers. Just two teams of six in a tight pitch. Ideal for developing scanning, first touch under pressure, and support movement. I’ve used this to help players adjust to faster decisions and learn to stay calm when space is restricted.

7. 7v7+1 – False 9 Play and Central Support

This format uses a joker as a central support. Think of it like a false 9 or advanced pivot. It works best when you’re developing ideas around linking midfield to attack. Great for creating and exploiting central overloads.

8. 8v8+2 – Coordinated Pressing

This one requires real team organisation. The ball starts on one side of the pitch and can only be transferred across through the jokers. Defending team must shift, screen, and anticipate. Brilliant for coaching rest defence, pressing triggers, and group compactness.

How To Coach These SSGs Effectively

Each of these SSGs can look chaotic if you let them. The key is to use short interventions. Freeze, ask questions, reset. Use prompts like:





“Where’s the space?”



“Who’s the extra player and how are we using them?”



“What could you have done before receiving the ball?”



“Can we switch the play earlier?”

I’ve found that these short, focused questions stick better than long explanations. Players stay involved and reflect in action.






How This Fits Into Your Week

Small sided games are best used either to begin a session with intensity or to finish with competition. I’ve also used them as the core of a whole practice – especially when working on decision-making, positional roles, or conditioning through game-based work.

You can layer rondos or technical patterns before these, or follow them with match play. The key is that these formats don’t require loads of setup. You get maximum outcomes with minimal time wasted.

Final Word

The SSGs in this cheatsheet aren’t magic. They’re not flashy. But they work. Because they create pressure, force decisions, and replicate the things players actually face in a game.

Pick one. Coach it well. Keep the outcomes front of mind. And build sessions where your players aren’t just active – they’re learning how to play the game.
