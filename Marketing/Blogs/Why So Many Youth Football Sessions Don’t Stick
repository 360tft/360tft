As coaches, we’ve all been there.

You plan a session, you run it well, and the players seem to enjoy it. It looks sharp. The intensity is good. You leave the pitch feeling like it went well. But then matchday rolls around, and none of it seems to transfer. The movement you taught doesn’t appear. The skill you spent time on isn’t used. The decisions players make don’t reflect anything from training.

And you’re left wondering:

Why aren’t they doing what we worked on?

So, why do so many youth football sessions not stick?

It’s easy to chalk it up to pressure, game pace, or nerves. But if it keeps happening, we need to take a step back and ask a harder question.

Are we actually teaching in a way that sticks?









Activity ≠ Learning

One of the biggest misconceptions in coaching is that if a session is active, it's effective. If players are engaged, moving, and enjoying themselves, we assume they're learning.

But learning doesn’t come from activity alone. It comes from repetition, recognition, and connection. It comes from building understanding over time, not from isolated drills that live and die inside one evening's training session.

Most youth football training is built around isolated moments. One week, you work on 1v1s. Next week, it’s playing out from the back. Then maybe it’s finishing from cutbacks. Each session feels valuable on its own, but the ideas aren’t connected, and the progression isn’t planned.

It becomes a sequence of unrelated lessons. Each week, players are being introduced to something new, but nothing sticks because nothing is reinforced. You’re resetting every session.

And that’s exhausting ...... for you and for them.

The Impact of Disconnected Coaching

When coaching lacks structure, it becomes reactionary. You respond to the last result, or to what didn’t go well in the last session. You see something online and try it. You download a new drill and build a session around it. None of this is wrong in isolation, but over time, it leads to sessions that don’t build on each other.

Players stop recognising patterns. They don’t get to revisit skills in different contexts. Instead, they develop surface-level familiarity with a lot of concepts, but never gain real depth in any of them. The result? Confusion in the game, slow decision-making, and reliance on instinct instead of understanding.

And perhaps most importantly, confidence erodes. Players lose belief in their ability to apply what they’ve learned. Coaches lose belief in whether they’re making an impact.

Why It Feels Like They're Not Learning (But They Are — Just Not Enough)

Let’s take a real example. You run a dribbling session on Tuesday. Players work on changes of direction, using both feet, beating a defender in a 1v1 situation. It goes well. Then on Sunday, they receive the ball wide, isolated in a 1v1, and pass backwards or stop completely.

You think, “We worked on this all week. Why didn’t they try something?”

The answer is usually that they didn’t recognise the situation. The conditions in the session were different. The cues were different. They haven’t had enough varied exposure to make the connection in a real game moment. The skill hasn’t moved from practice into memory, and definitely not into instinct.

We forget that learning takes time. And transfer — the ability to apply something under pressure — doesn’t happen through repetition alone. It happens through repetition with variation, in meaningful, game-related scenarios.

So What’s the Solution?

To break the cycle, we need to rethink what a “good” session looks like. Not just in terms of how it feels, but in terms of what it contributes to long-term learning.

The answer isn’t to simplify everything or repeat the same drill for weeks. It’s time to start coaching with connected ideas. That means:





Picking one clear focus each week and sticking with it



Designing sessions that revisit the same idea in different ways: technical warm-up, scenario-based practice, small-sided game, and match play



Creating environments where players see the same problem multiple times, and are encouraged to solve it using tools they’ve developed



Allowing space for failure, experimentation, and reflection — because learning isn’t clean

This approach isn’t about being rigid. It’s about being intentional. When your players start to anticipate situations, recognise patterns, and make the right decision without prompting, that’s when you know it’s working.







How This Might Look in Practice

Say you’re coaching U9s, and your theme is “receiving to turn in central areas.” You start the session with a simple ball mastery warm-up focused on body shape and scanning. You follow it with a 3v3 or 4v2 activity where players receive with pressure coming from behind or the side. Then you play a small-sided game where goals are scored through central channels, and players must play forward quickly.

Throughout the session, the message is clear: Can you receive to play forward? Can you do it when you don’t know who’s around you? What helps you make that decision?  Can you thrive in the chaos?

By the time you get to match play, players are experiencing those same cues in a more chaotic environment, but they’ve already seen it, felt it, and made decisions on it. Now, say you revisit this theme in a few weeks, just enough time for players to start to forget it, and reiterate the same coaching points.That’s how we move from repetition to retention.  That's how we move from knowing a drill to recalling how to solve a problem in a game scenario.

It’s Not About Doing More, It’s About Doing It Better

You don’t need to coach more. You don’t need new equipment. You don’t even need better players.

You just need a plan that allows your coaching to stick. A structure that supports learning over time. One that allows you to revisit key moments and help players not just understand the game, but act on it with confidence.

If you’ve been stuck in that cycle of coaching effort without visible impact, it’s not because you’re doing it wrong. It’s because most coaches are operating without a framework that supports true development.
