Rondos are everywhere now. Every coach uses them. But the truth is, most coaches are using them as a warm-up, a time filler, or a way to get players moving without really thinking about what’s being learned.

This post is different. It’s built around the Rondo Cheatsheet I put together, a tool I created to help coaches like you build rondos that connect to the game, that develop actual game habits, and that challenge players technically and mentally.

The Real Purpose of a Rondo

Let’s be clear: a rondo isn’t just a keep-ball activity. Or at least it shouldn’t be. When designed properly, it helps players:





Play under pressure



Recognise angles and support quickly



Make decisions with minimal time



Improve first touch, passing tempo, and ball security

I’ve used these variations in different settings, and I’ve used them with grassroots teams too. And when I see coaches still running the same 5v2 grid every week with no constraint or purpose, I know they’re missing the point.

The Rondo Cheatsheet: 8 Variations With A Purpose

Every rondo in this cheatsheet is included because it teaches something slightly different. It’s not about having 100 ideas. It’s about knowing when and why to use the right one.





4v2 Square – Builds shape and teaches players to support off angles



3v1 Bounce – Helps develop third-player movement and combination play



Directional Rondo – Adds goals or end zones to force penetration and switch of play



4 Goal Rondo – Encourages scanning, switching play, and recognising space



Overload Rondo – Manipulates numbers to focus on movement and balance



1-2 Rondo – Forces players to work on give-and-go combinations with tempo



2 Touch Rondo – Reduces time on the ball, encourages quick decisions



3 Team Rotation Rondo – Adds dynamic movement, rotation, and transitions

What they all have in common is that they’re designed to build a game habit. It’s not about ticking off an activity. It’s about sharpening the stuff that matters when the whistle goes.

How I’ve Used These Variations

I’ve used the 4v2 Square with players who needed help building that diamond shape under pressure. I’ve used the 4 Goal Rondo when working on playing out and breaking lines. And I’ve used the 3 Team Rotation format with older players to simulate constant transition moments.

Each one fits a coaching moment. That’s the key. You don’t throw these in randomly. You pick the variation that matches the problem you’re trying to solve.









Coach Prompts That Make The Rondo Stick

Too many coaches just let rondos run. The real value is in what you say while it’s happening. Use clear prompts like:





“What angle can you play from next?”



“Can you support on the blindside?”



“Is there a switch on?”



“What’s your next movement after the pass?”

These aren’t lectures. They’re nudges. They keep players thinking, adjusting, and refining.

What Comes Next? Where This Fits In Your Coaching

If you’re building your coaching around clarity and structure, this is just the start. The rondo formats help players become more confident in possession — but it has to feed into the bigger picture.

It’s easy to run a rondo that looks sharp. But the real work is in making it connect.

That’s what this cheatsheet is built for. And that’s what 360TFT is about, clarity, purpose, and helping you become the coach that builds habits that stick.
