Hi,

Week 5 is here! We've finished with the foundation session series, so now we're going to move to our problem solver series.  This series will explore common youth football problems that coaches send me.

"My team is forever bunching" is something I hear often.  So, how to fix it?

For me, you play small-sided games, and you reward the players who avoid bunching and spread out 

The session below encourages players to switch the ball often and gives the coach a chance to talk about the width and depth football principles.

p.s. If you don't have 8 goals, use 4.  Alternatively, use cone gates.  Adapt and overcome!



This Week's Session: 7v7 Defending







Need quick solutions for every coaching challenge? Our Coaching Cheatsheet Vault, which gives you instant access to proven methods for every situation.  Especially, when you need to adapt and overcome due to a lack of player numbers or equipment.

See you next Tuesday when we look at encouraging players who only use their strong/dominant foot to use both feet.
