Hi,

Welcome to your weekly session delivery. 

Every Tuesday, you'll get a complete, ready-to-use session plan that your players will love and that actually develops their football intelligence.


Today's session focuses on passing and receiving on the move, the foundation skill that separates good players from great ones.




Try this session this week and watch how quickly your players improve their passing rhythm and spatial awareness.
