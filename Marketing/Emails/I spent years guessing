Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'll be honest with you.

For the first few years of my coaching career, I was making it up as I went along.

Thought that's what coaching was, throwing drills at problems and hoping something would stick.

Spent hours planning sessions that didn't address the real issues. Watched players make the same mistakes week after week. Felt like I was working harder than anyone, but getting nowhere.

Sound familiar?

The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to fix everything and started diagnosing first.

Instead of guessing what was wrong, I learned to identify the specific problem. Instead of hoping for improvements, I built systems that created them.

That's exactly what I've put into The Coach's Compass.

It's a 7-day system that takes you from guessing what's wrong with your team to knowing exactly how to fix it.





Day 1: 5-Minute Team Diagnostic - Know exactly what's holding your team back 



Day 2: Emergency Session Plans - Immediate fixes that work 



Day 3: Mindset Reset Protocol - Build unshakeable confidence 



Day 4: Small-Sided Game Mastery - Training that transfers to matches 



Day 5: Formation Fix - Stop playing players out of position 



Day 6: Match Day Confidence - Bridge training to performance 



Day 7: Complete Integration - Long-term systematic development

I'm giving this away because I know what it's like to feel stuck as a coach. It's not great, it's lonely, and when you ask for help, you get opinions, not systems.

This is the system I wish I'd had when I started.

Just type in Â£0 and press "I want this" - you'll get instant access to all 7 days.

Your next training session is coming. You can arrive with another drill you found online, or you can arrive knowing exactly what your team needs.

The choice is yours.

P.S. This isn't just another collection of drills. It's a complete coaching philosophy that builds systematic improvement.
