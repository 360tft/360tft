Hi,

Week 6 is here!  How did last week go?  Thanks to everyone who hit reply to give me feedback on the session I sent you. 

"My players won't use both feet" is another common complaint I receive from coaches. So, what's the problem?  Well, being one-footed is a technical limitation that will lead to technical errors in adult football. 

Players need to be encouraged to use both feet.

So, the session below really encourages them to do so through the rules of the game.  I've used it hundreds of times, and it works!

p.s. If you don't have 4 goals, use cone gates.  Adapt and overcome!
