Hi,



Week 3 is here! This session develops creativity and problem-solving, the skills that separate good players from great ones.  It does this by recreating how we used to play in the streets with our friends






Try this session and watch your players become more creative under pressure.


Want to master ball skills training? Check out our Complete Ball Mastery Sessions - 45 sessions that develop players with unshakeable first touch and street football creativity.




See you next Tuesday,




Kevin

P.S. Run the session and let me know if any player tried to go 1v2 and show creativity in the session.
