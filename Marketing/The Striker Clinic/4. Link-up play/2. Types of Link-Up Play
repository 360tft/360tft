Section Introduction

Link-up play is the foundation of a striker's ability to connect with teammates and influence the game beyond scoring goals. It involves a variety of techniques and movements that allow strikers to maintain possession, create opportunities, and contribute to the team’s overall attacking structure. 



You can see in the above clip that one-two Manchester City employ leads to a goal.  Note how Haaland uses his left foot to pass and right foot to finish, with the passes going to the correct part of the receivers foot so the speed of play is difficult to defend against.

Link-up play contains the basic elements of passing and does not need to complicated. 

From quick one-touch combinations to intricate hold-up play, understanding the different types of link-up play equips strikers with the tools to adapt to various game situations and maximize their impact on the pitch. This section explores the key forms of link-up play and their significance in modern football, and contains the following:





One-Touch Passing: Quickly returning passes to teammates to maintain attacking momentum.



Wall Passes (Give-and-Go): Combining with a teammate to bypass defenders.



Hold-Up Play: Retaining possession to allow teammates to move into advanced positions.



Wide Play and Crossing: Linking up with wide players to attack crosses.



Combination Play in Tight Spaces: Using quick, short passes to unlock compact defences.



Types of Link-Up Play

Link-up play encompasses a variety of techniques and movements that enable a striker to connect effectively with their teammates. Understanding these types and when to use them is essential for maximizing attacking opportunities.



1. One-Touch Passing

One-touch passing is a hallmark of quick and efficient link-up play. Strikers use this to maintain the momentum of an attack, often redirecting the ball to an onrushing teammate.





Effective in breaking high-press systems.



Requires sharp awareness and clean technique to execute successfully.

One-touch play involves executing passes or shots immediately upon receiving the ball, without taking additional touches. This rapid interaction accelerates the tempo of attacks, catching defenders off-guard and creating openings in tightly organized defences.

Strikers utilizing one-touch play must possess an acute awareness of their surroundings, anticipating the movement of teammates and opponents alike. This foresight allows them to make swift decisions that maintain the fluidity of the attack.

Practising one-touch drills with teammates can enhance this skill, fostering a mutual understanding that is crucial for successful execution during matches. Such drills improve reaction times and the ability to deliver precise passes under pressure.

Moreover, one-touch play is particularly effective in congested areas of the pitch, such as the penalty box, where time and space are limited. A quick layoff or flick can unlock defences and create scoring opportunities.

However, the risk associated with one-touch play is the increased chance of miscommunication or inaccurate passes. Therefore, it requires a high level of technical proficiency and chemistry among players.

Incorporating one-touch play into a striker's repertoire adds unpredictability to their game, making it more challenging for defenders to anticipate their actions. This unpredictability can lead to defensive errors and goal-scoring chances.

Additionally, one-touch play can be instrumental in quick counter-attacking situations, where speed is essential to exploit the opposition's disorganization. A swift one-touch pass can transition the ball from defence to attack in seconds.

Coaches often emphasize the importance of one-touch play in training sessions to develop players' ability to operate under high-pressure conditions, simulating real-match scenarios where quick decision-making is crucial.

Overall, mastering one-touch play enhances a striker's efficiency and effectiveness, contributing to a more dynamic and cohesive attacking unit.







Quick passing drills that contains movement in and around the box will help players build understanding and momentum.  In the above image you can see that the exercise incorporates hold-up play, combinations, wall passes, and third man movements.



2. Wall Passes (Give-and-Go)

A classic combination move where the striker passes to a teammate and immediately runs into space to receive the return pass.





Ideal for bypassing defenders in tight areas.



Encourages coordinated movement and timing.

Wall passes, also known as "give-and-go" or "one-two's", are one of the simplest yet most effective forms of link-up play in football. This technique involves a striker passing the ball to a teammate and immediately making a forward run to receive the ball back, bypassing a defender or creating space for an attacking opportunity.

Wall passes are especially effective in tight spaces where defenders are compact and pressing aggressively. By using a quick give-and-go, the striker can escape their marker and penetrate the defensive line. The speed and simplicity of a wall pass make it particularly difficult for defenders to track both the passer and the runner.

A key to executing wall passes successfully is timing. The striker must play the ball with enough precision and weight that their teammate can return it smoothly, without breaking the attacking rhythm. Simultaneously, the striker’s run must be well-timed to avoid being caught offside or intercepted by a defender.

Wall passes are not limited to central areas. Strikers can use this technique near the flanks, combining with wingers or fullbacks to create opportunities for crosses or cutbacks. This versatility makes the wall pass a valuable tool in a striker’s skill set.

One of the main advantages of wall passes is that they exploit defenders' tendencies to focus on the ball. When executed correctly, the ball carrier draws the attention of the defender, allowing the runner to slip into open space unnoticed.

Strikers must develop chemistry with their teammates to execute wall passes effectively. This understanding ensures both players anticipate the movement and timing of the play. Regular practice of give-and-go drills can foster this coordination and improve execution during matches.

Wall passes are also an excellent tool for breaking down high defensive lines. When a defender steps forward to challenge the striker, the quick exchange of passes allows the striker to exploit the space left behind.

In training, wall passes can be simulated using static targets, such as mannequins, or dynamic scenarios with defenders. These drills help strikers refine their touch, passing accuracy, and timing under various levels of pressure.

Coaches often emphasize the importance of body orientation during wall passes. Strikers should position themselves so they can turn and accelerate immediately after receiving the return pass, maximizing their ability to capitalize on the created space.

Overall, wall passes are an essential component of a striker’s repertoire, combining technical precision, tactical awareness, and coordination with teammates to create scoring opportunities in various situations.

3. Hold-Up Play

Hold-up play involves the striker receiving the ball under pressure, shielding it from defenders, and waiting for teammates to join the attack. This form of link-up play is essential for teams looking to retain possession and build attacks patiently.

A striker's physicality plays a crucial role in hold-up play. They must use their body effectively to shield the ball, maintain balance, and withstand challenges from defenders. This often requires strength training to improve core stability and upper body strength.

Good hold-up play also depends on the striker's ability to read the game. They must anticipate when and where their teammates will arrive to release the ball at the right moment.

Strikers practising hold-up play often engage in 1v1 or 2v2 drills where they receive the ball with their back to the goal and are tasked with maintaining possession against a defender.

An excellent first touch is critical for successful hold-up play. Strikers must control the ball immediately upon receiving it, keeping it close to their body to prevent defenders from intercepting it.

Hold-up play also allows the team to transition smoothly from defence to attack. By holding the ball up and giving midfielders time to advance, strikers ensure the team maintains its shape and attacking options.

Additionally, hold-up play can be a defensive asset. Strikers who can relieve pressure by holding the ball in advanced areas prevent the opposition from launching quick counterattacks.









In this drill, the striker receives the ball with their back to goal, shields it from a defender, and executes one of the following:





A quick turn and shot.



A pass back to the coach for a one-two before finishing.



4. Through Balls and Layoffs

A striker receives the ball with their back to goal and lays it off to a teammate who is advancing into space.





Effective in setting up midfielders or wingers for shots or crosses.



Combines well with one-touch play to maintain the flow of an attack.





The player starts deep and makes a well-timed run in behind as the ball is played from midfield.  This pass can be a direct pass from a coach/parent or involving a bounce pass as shown in the diagram.



5. Wide Play and Crossing

Wide play and crossing are vital components of a striker's role, enabling them to exploit space, stretch defences, and create goal-scoring opportunities for themselves and their teammates. Strikers who excel in wide play and crossing understand how to link up with wide players, make intelligent runs into the box, and finish from a variety of deliveries.

Wide play refers to a team’s ability to utilise the flanks during attacks, while crossing involves delivering the ball from wide areas into the penalty box to create scoring chances. For strikers, this often means positioning themselves to connect with crosses or drifting into wide areas to assist in creating opportunities.

Crossing plays a crucial role in bypassing compact defences and exploiting space left by the opposition’s full-backs. A well-delivered cross can lead to high-quality chances, whether it’s a lofted ball for a header, a driven pass for a first-time finish, or a cut-back to an oncoming midfielder.

Strikers contribute to wide play by:





Making Decoy Runs: Drawing defenders away to create space for wide players to cross.



Providing a Target in the Box: Positioning themselves intelligently to attack the ball when the cross is delivered.



Combining with Wide Players: Drifting wide to assist wingers or full-backs with overlaps, underlaps, or one-twos.



Finishing: Executing a variety of finishes, from headers to volleys, depending on the type of cross delivered.

A striker’s involvement in wide play requires excellent timing, movement, and communication with their teammates.

Strikers must be prepared to adapt their positioning and finishing techniques based on the type of cross:





Lofted Crosses: Delivered high into the box, these are ideal for aerial duels and headers.



Low-Driven Crosses: Played sharply across the ground, requiring quick reactions and precise finishing.



Cut-Backs: Delivered from near the byline back toward the penalty spot, providing opportunities for first-time finishes.



Whipped Crosses: Curved deliveries aimed between the defensive line and goalkeeper, forcing defenders to make difficult decisions.

Each type of cross offers unique challenges and opportunities, making versatility essential for strikers.

The timing of a striker’s run is critical in wide play and crossing situations. Arriving in the box too early allows defenders to adjust, while arriving too late means missing the opportunity. Strikers should aim to time their runs so they meet the ball at the optimal moment for a finish.

Practising timing drills, such as running toward cones placed at different points in the penalty area, can help strikers fine-tune their instincts.





This individual exercises lets forward players drive in from a wide area to finish and then pull wide to run in behind to receive and cross.



5. Movement in the Box

Strikers need to master various movements to lose their markers and position themselves effectively:





Near-Post Runs: Attacking the space closest to the crosser, often beating defenders to the ball.



Far-Post Runs: Targeting the back post for lofted crosses or when the ball bypasses the defensive line.



Penalty Spot Positioning: Holding a central position to attack cut-backs or rebounds.



Double Movements: Faking a run to one direction before cutting back to lose a defender.

These movements create unpredictability, making it harder for defenders to track the striker.



6. Combination Play in Tight Spaces

In compact defensive setups, intricate passing sequences involving the striker can unlock defences.





Requires quick decision-making and technical precision.



Commonly used in the final third where space is limited.

Combination play refers to coordinated interactions between multiple players to advance the ball and create scoring opportunities. It often involves short passes, overlaps, underlaps, and third-man runs, requiring a high level of understanding and synchronization among teammates.

One of the most common forms of combination play is the one-two pass, where two players exchange quick passes to bypass a defender. This move relies on timing and precision to exploit gaps in the defensive line.

Another key element of combination play is the third-man run. In this scenario, two players exchange passes while a third player makes a run into space, often receiving the ball in a more advanced position. This dynamic movement creates confusion among defenders and opens up attacking opportunities.

Combination play is especially effective in the final third, where space is limited, and defenses are compact. Quick, precise passes and synchronized movements can unbalance even the most organized backlines.

Strikers play a pivotal role in combination play, often acting as the central hub through which passes flow. Their ability to hold the ball, distribute it accurately, and make intelligent runs ensures the success of these coordinated moves.

Practicing combination play requires regular repetition and clear communication. Drills often involve small-sided games or rondos, where players must execute short passes and coordinated movements under pressure.

The versatility of combination play makes it valuable in various game scenarios. It can be used to build from the back, transition through midfield, or create chances in the attacking third. This adaptability makes it an essential aspect of a striker’s skill set.

Strikers must also develop a strong understanding of their teammates’ tendencies and movement patterns to excel in combination play. This chemistry ensures smooth execution and increases the likelihood of creating scoring opportunities.

In training, coaches often simulate match scenarios where combination play is required. For example, strikers might practice linking with wingers in wide areas or combining with midfielders in central zones.

Lastly, combination play fosters teamwork and creativity, encouraging players to think collectively and improvise solutions to break down defences. Strikers who master this skill contribute significantly to their team’s attacking fluidity and overall success.







By playing match type training game, but with reduced space, you will force players to look for different solutions to solve the problems the game presents.   In this drill, the pitch is thin so players will need to utlise combination play to find space.



7. Overlapping and Underlapping Runs

Overlapping runs are critical for maintaining width in the attack, especially against compact defences. By stretching the opposition horizontally, they create space for strikers and midfielders to exploit centrally.

For a striker, the presence of overlapping runs offers two primary benefits:





Creates Space: When a defender follows the overlapping player, it leaves the striker with more room to manoeuvre.



Provides Options: The overlapping player often becomes a crossing or passing outlet, giving the striker a chance to position themselves for a finish.

This form of link-up play is particularly effective in wide areas, where a full-back or winger can deliver dangerous crosses into the box.

Underlapping runs, on the other hand, are designed to exploit gaps between the opposition's centre-backs and full-backs. These runs are highly effective in breaking through defensive lines and creating scoring opportunities in central areas.

For a striker, underlapping runs provide:





Disruption of Defensive Lines: The movement draws defenders out of position, opening gaps for the striker or other attackers to exploit.



Direct Goal Threat: Underlapping players often find themselves in prime positions to receive through balls and take shots on goal.

This form of link-up play is particularly useful against teams that defend deep, as it creates diagonal passing lanes that are difficult to intercept.

Strikers play a pivotal role in initiating and capitalising on these runs. They must:





Recognise the Movement: Strikers need to anticipate when a teammate is about to make an overlapping or underlapping run.



Position Themselves Effectively: Whether creating space by drawing defenders or positioning for a return pass, strikers must read the play intelligently.



Communicate: Clear verbal and non-verbal signals, such as pointing or calling for the ball, ensure smooth execution.

Strikers also need to adjust their movement based on the type of run. For overlapping runs, they may pull defenders centrally to create space on the flanks. For underlapping runs, they may hold their position or make a complementary run to receive a cut-back pass.





This unopposed practice can be run with a minimum of 5 players and a maximum of a full squad.  Strikers will get lots of repetition of attacking crosses after an underlap.



8. Decoy Runs and False Movements

Link-up play doesn’t always involve touching the ball. Decoy runs and false movements draw defenders out of position, creating space for teammates.

Decoy runs and false movements are advanced forms of attacking play designed to manipulate the opposition’s defensive structure. Strikers use these movements to draw defenders out of position, create space for teammates, and increase unpredictability in the attack. Mastering these techniques elevates a striker’s effectiveness by enabling them to impact the game even without directly involving the ball.





Decoy Runs: These are deliberate movements by the striker aimed at drawing defenders away from critical areas. For example, a striker might sprint toward the wing to pull a centre-back out of position, creating space for an onrushing midfielder.



False Movements: These are subtle feints or misdirections where the striker begins a run in one direction but quickly changes it to another, confusing the defender and gaining an advantage.

Both movements rely on tactical intelligence, precise timing, and an understanding of the team’s overall attacking strategy.

Decoy runs are primarily used to disrupt the opposition’s defensive organisation. By pulling defenders out of position, these runs open up gaps in the defensive line that teammates can exploit. For example:





A striker dragging a centre-back wide leaves space in the middle for a midfielder to run into.



Moving toward the near post during a cross can pull a defender away, allowing another attacker to exploit the far post.

These runs are particularly effective in breaking down compact defences, where creating space is a significant challenge.

False movements are designed to deceive defenders and gain positional advantage. For example, a striker might start a run toward the ball to suggest they’re coming short, only to quickly spin and run in behind the defensive line. This subtle misdirection often catches defenders off-guard and creates clear scoring opportunities.

False movements are also useful in creating separation. By wrong-footing their marker, the striker gains time and space to receive the ball and make their next action.







There are lots of dynamic movement patterns in this drill, including an off the ball run.   At any level of the game, this would be difficult to defend against if the passing, number of touches, and movement were all timed correctly.



9. Linking in Transition

During counterattacks, strikers act as the focal point for quick, direct passing to exploit disorganized defences.

Linking in transition is a critical skill for strikers, enabling them to maintain the team’s attacking momentum as they move from defence to attack. This phase of play requires quick thinking, sharp decision-making, and precise execution to exploit spaces created during defensive transitions. Strikers who excel at linking in transition not only create opportunities 

Transition refers to the moment a team regains possession and shifts from defending to attacking. This phase is often chaotic, with the opposition temporarily disorganised and vulnerable. Strikers play a pivotal role in ensuring that the transition is swift and efficient, turning defensive recovery into an attacking opportunity.

By linking play during transitions, strikers help to establish a direct route to the opposition’s goal. They provide a vital outlet for midfielders or defenders looking to escape pressure and initiate an attack. The ability to maintain control and distribute accurately during this high-pressure phase is what separates good strikers from great ones.

A striker’s role during transitions involves several key responsibilities:





Providing an Outlet: The striker must position themselves to receive the ball from deep positions, acting as a target for quick forward passes.



Holding Possession: If under pressure, the striker must shield the ball and give teammates time to advance.



Distributing the Ball: Strikers must make quick, accurate decisions to pass to a teammate in a better attacking position or switch play to exploit space.



Continuing Their Run: After linking play, the striker should transition into an attacking role, often positioning themselves to receive a return pass or move into a scoring position.







Having target end players encourages a "first pass forward" into a strikers feet.  This drill is excellent at encouraging this.



10. Target Play

Target play is a crucial aspect of a striker's role, especially in systems that rely on holding possession and building attacks through a central focal point. It involves the striker acting as the primary target for passes, controlling the ball under pressure, and linking play with their teammates. This skill is particularly important in counterattacks, set-piece situations, and games where the team needs to bypass a pressing midfield.

Target play refers to a striker's ability to serve as the focal point of the attack. In this role, the striker receives passes from defenders or midfielders, holds up the ball, and distributes it to advancing teammates. The objective is to maintain possession, relieve pressure, and create attacking opportunities.

This type of play often requires a combination of technical skill, physicality, and tactical awareness. Strikers must be adept at controlling the ball, shielding it from defenders, and making accurate passes, all while under pressure.

Target play is vital for several reasons:





Maintaining Possession: By holding up the ball, the striker allows their team to retain possession in advanced areas, reducing the risk of turnovers.



Building Attacks: Target play provides a platform for the team to transition from defence to attack, particularly when bypassing the midfield.



Relieving Pressure: When the team is under pressure, the striker's ability to act as a reliable outlet prevents the opposition from regaining possession quickly.



Creating Space: By drawing defenders towards them, the striker can create space for 

Target play places significant demands on a striker’s physical and technical attributes:





Strength: Strikers must use their body to shield the ball and hold off defenders.



Balance: Maintaining stability while under pressure is essential for effective target play.



First Touch: A precise first touch allows the striker to control the ball and set up their next action.



Passing Accuracy: Strikers need to deliver accurate lay-offs or through balls to teammates.



Spatial Awareness: Understanding the positioning of teammates and defenders helps the striker make better decisions.

The striker's responsibilities in target play include:





Holding the Ball: Controlling and shielding the ball under pressure to buy time for teammates.



Linking Play: Connecting with midfielders, wingers, or overlapping full-backs through accurate passes.



Drawing Defenders: Attracting defenders’ attention to create space for others.



Transitioning Quickly: After holding the ball, the striker must quickly transition into an attacking position, often following up their pass with a run into the box.
