Introduction

Link-up play is where finesse meets functionality for strikers—it’s not just about flair but the ability to connect, create, and contribute seamlessly to the team’s attack. Think of it as being the perfect puzzle piece that bridges midfield to the final third. To master link-up play, strikers must develop a blend of technical precision, tactical awareness, and physical resilience, all while maintaining their composure under pressure.

In this section, we’ll unpack the essential skills every striker needs to thrive in link-up play, from the delicate art of the first touch to the strategic brilliance of spatial awareness. These aren’t just tools in a striker’s toolbox—they’re the keys to unlocking defences and keeping your team one step ahead of the opposition. So, let’s dive in and refine the craft of connecting play like the maestro you were born to be!

The Key Skills

1. First Touch

A striker’s first touch is the foundation of effective link-up play. It sets the tone for what happens next, whether it’s controlling a pass under pressure, setting up a shot, or releasing the ball to a teammate.





Purposeful Touch: The first touch should be deliberate and directed toward the intended action—whether it’s laying off the ball, turning to face the goal, or moving away from pressure.



Control Under Pressure: Strikers often receive passes with defenders close by, requiring a first touch that shields the ball while maintaining possession.



Adjusting to Ball Speed and Angle: A well-rounded striker can handle passes at varying speeds and from different angles. This includes cushioning high balls, controlling hard-driven passes, and redirecting the ball into space.



Practice Focus: Repetitive drills, such as rondos or 1v1 pressure scenarios, can help strikers refine their first touch and adaptability.



Game Impact: A quality first touch allows the striker to link play seamlessly, keeping the attack fluid and reducing turnovers.



2. Passing Accuracy

Accurate passing is crucial for strikers to connect with teammates and sustain attacking momentum. This applies to both short, quick passes in tight spaces and longer, more strategic passes.





Short Passing: In one-twos or combination play, precision is critical. Misplaced passes can break the rhythm and squander attacking opportunities.



Weighted Passes: Strikers must master delivering passes with the correct weight, whether threading a through ball or executing a delicate lay-off.



Variety in Passing: Strikers need versatility—switching play to a winger, delivering a one-touch pass to a midfielder, or playing a lofted ball to a full-back.



Practice Focus: Passing drills with varying distances and pressure help develop accuracy, speed, and consistency.



Game Impact: Precise passing builds trust with teammates and ensures the striker remains a vital link in attacking transitions.



3. Ball Shielding and Strength

Strikers often need to hold the ball under pressure to allow teammates time to support the attack. Effective ball shielding combines physical strength, balance, and technique.





Using the Body: Strikers should position themselves between the ball and the defender, using their body to shield possession.



Low Centre of Gravity: Maintaining a strong, low stance enhances stability and makes it harder for defenders to dispossess the striker.



Pivoting: The ability to pivot while shielding the ball opens up passing angles and allows for quick turns to escape pressure.



Practice Focus: 1v1 shielding drills and resistance exercises improve physical strength and balance.



Game Impact: Strong ball shielding ensures possession is retained in crucial moments, especially in transition or counterattacking phases.







Shielding and hiding the ball from a defender is something all top strikers are able to do.



4. Spatial Awareness

Understanding space and positioning is essential for effective link-up play. Strikers must be aware of their surroundings to anticipate movements, avoid defensive pressure, and exploit gaps.





Scanning: Regularly scanning the field helps strikers identify where teammates and opponents are positioned.



Anticipating Movements: Strikers need to read the game to predict where space will open up or where a teammate might make a run.



Positioning Between Lines: Effective link-up play often requires strikers to position themselves between the opposition’s midfield and defensive lines.



Practice Focus: Drills involving quick decision-making under pressure help develop spatial awareness.



Game Impact: Superior spatial awareness enables strikers to make better decisions, create space for teammates, and unbalance defensive structures.

5. Timing and Movement

Timing and movement are vital for creating space, receiving the ball, and executing successful link-up play. A striker’s ability to move intelligently often dictates the flow of an attack.





Decoy Runs: Pulling defenders away to create space for teammates or repositioning for better opportunities.



Double Movements: Faking one run before changing direction to lose a marker.



Anticipating Passes: Timing runs to perfection ensures the striker meets the ball at the right moment, avoiding offside traps.



Practice Focus: Movement drills, including overlapping runs and timed sprints, refine a striker’s ability to manipulate defensive lines.



Game Impact: Well-timed movements open up passing lanes and create dynamic attacking opportunities.





Timing and movement rarely relies on just one player, but a whole team being on the same page.



6. Communication

Clear communication between the striker and their teammates is essential for coordinated link-up play. This includes both verbal and non-verbal cues.





Verbal Communication: Calling for the ball, indicating where to pass, or signalling intent helps teammates anticipate the striker’s movements.



Non-Verbal Cues: Gestures such as pointing, nodding, or subtle body movements provide additional guidance.



Encouraging Chemistry: Consistent communication fosters trust and understanding within the team, enhancing overall attacking efficiency.



Practice Focus: Small-sided games and positional drills encourage real-time communication between players.



Game Impact: Effective communication ensures attacking plays are well-executed and minimises misunderstandings in critical moments.





You can see that the crosser has numerous teammates to pass to - one is pointing the space he wants the ball and the other is a striker who adopts the same position for crosses each game.

Both players make the task of delivering the cross easier on the player with the ball.





7. Vision and Creativity

Vision and creativity allow strikers to see opportunities others might miss, turning potential plays into decisive attacking moments.





Reading Defences: A striker with great vision can identify defensive weaknesses, such as unmarked players or exploitable gaps.



Creative Playmaking: Through flicks, backheels, or unexpected passes, strikers can unlock defences and create chances for teammates.



Expanding Passing Options: Vision enables strikers to see and execute complex passes, such as splitting the defence with a through ball.



Practice Focus: Drills that simulate high-pressure situations, encouraging quick and inventive decision-making, and enhance creativity.



Game Impact: Vision and creativity make strikers unpredictable, keeping defenders guessing and opening up the game.



8. Decision-Making Under Pressure

Strikers often operate in high-pressure situations where quick, accurate decisions are critical. The ability to stay composed and choose the best option is a hallmark of effective link-up play.





Reading the Situation: Assessing whether to pass, shoot, or hold the ball based on the surrounding context.



Adapting to Pressure: Strikers must learn to handle defensive pressure while maintaining clarity in their decisions.



Minimising Hesitation: Training to trust instincts and commit to decisions reduces costly delays in attacking sequences.



Practice Focus: High-intensity drills that simulate game scenarios build decision-making confidence.



Game Impact: Composed decision-making ensures the striker remains effective under pressure, maximising opportunities for their team.
