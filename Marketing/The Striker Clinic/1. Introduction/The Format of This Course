The format of this course is simple.   We will display the theory behind several topics:





Different Types of Striker Movement



Different Types of Striker Link Up Play



Striker Defending



Finishing Techniques



The Mental Qualities of Strikers

Giving video and image examples of each so you can conceptually understand what we are detailing.

We will then provide session plans for:





Individual Players



Coaches

To practice and/or teach each of the topics we cover.

These session plans are contained within each topic, and on their own in separate sections so you can quickly find a practice to help you and your team excel.

Almost all of the sessions can be scaled back to be done on an individual 1-2-1 basis or be scaled up to be done with a full team.

So, you can:





Go through this course end-to-end



Dip in and out of sections as you please



Head straight to the session plans and start coaching the topics



Head to the session plans as a reference plan after you have completed the course
