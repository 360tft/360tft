Section Introduction 

If a defender is tight, you can use your body to manipulate them in order to gain an advantage. This can be done by either; 

1. Using your body and skill to roll your defender and/or get turned! 

2. Pinning your defender, looking to hold the ball up and link in with other team-mates!

You can see an example of this in the video.  Note the way the striker uses his body to hold off the defender and then spins to finish - perfection!

Why Turning a Defender is Crucial for a Striker

Turning a defender is one of the most effective ways for a striker to create space, generate goal-scoring opportunities, and keep defenders guessing. It’s not just about physicality; it’s a combination of skill, awareness, and timing that allows you to outmanoeuvre even the tightest of markers. Here’s why it’s important and how to make it part of your game:

1. Breaking Defensive Pressure

When a defender is tight to you, their primary goal is to restrict your ability to face the goal. Turning them immediately flips the situation in your favour by:





Putting the defender on the back foot.



Giving you the space and angle to attack directly.



Forcing defensive adjustments can open gaps for teammates.



2. Using Your Body to Gain an Advantage

Manipulating the defender’s positioning is key to turning effectively:





Rolling the Defender:
If the defender is overly tight, use their momentum against them by spinning away. A simple touch in the direction you want to turn can leave them wrong-footed.



Pinning the Defender:
If the defender is close but passive, use your body to shield the ball, giving you time to decide whether to turn or link up with teammates.





As you can see from this clip, Victor Osimhen (one of the best turners in the world), receives the pass and has two teammates in front of him to pass to.





He deceives the defender, who gets really tight, by faking to pass to a teammate.





He then uses the outside of his foot to turn the defender.





To drive forward and attack the backline (creating a 3v2 in Napoli's favour).



3. Creating Goal-Scoring Opportunities

Turning a defender can lead directly to goal-scoring chances. Once you’ve turned:





You may have a clear path to shoot.



You can drive into open space, forcing other defenders to commit and creating openings for your team.



You can combine with teammates for quick one-twos or crosses.



4. Keeping Defenders Guessing

By mastering the ability to turn quickly, you make yourself unpredictable. Defenders will hesitate to get too tight, fearing you’ll spin past them, which can give you more room to operate.



5. Improving Team Play

Turning a defender doesn’t always mean you go for the goal yourself. It can also help:





Transition quickly into attack, moving the ball to dangerous areas.



Draw additional defenders, opening up space for teammates to exploit.



Create opportunities for one-touch layoffs or through balls.



6. Skills to Master for Turning a Defender





First Touch: A clean, controlled first touch is essential to set up your turn.



Awareness: Know where the defender is and what space is available before you receive the ball.



Body Positioning: Stay side-on to shield the ball and be ready to pivot in either direction.



Explosiveness: A quick turn with an explosive first step can leave defenders trailing.



Deception: Use feints and body movements to mislead the defender about your intended direction.





Simple unopposed exercises where turning is involved can help build confidence in this cruicial skill.





7. Professional Examples





Lionel Messi: Known for his ability to turn defenders with minimal touches, creating space for his next move.



Didier Drogba: Used his strength and body positioning to roll defenders and get into shooting positions.

How To Turn a Defender - The Key Points





When receiving the ball, position yourself between the defender and the ball to make it harder for them to challenge.



Scan the field before the ball arrives so you know where to turn.



Practice timing and angles—turning at the right moment is just as important as the technique itself.

Turning a defender is a game-changing skill that combines physicality, technical ability, and tactical awareness. It allows you to break free from tight marking, create chances for yourself and your team, and keep defenders constantly guessing. Master this, and you’ll become a nightmare for defenders to deal with.

Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Turning a Defender (Players)





Technical Drill: Turning with the Ball







Setup: Use a small grid (10x10 meters) with a mannequin or cone in the center.



Execution:





Player starts outside the grid and drops deep into the grid.



A coach or partner passes the ball to the player as they drop.



Player practices receiving the ball with their back to goal, turning quickly, and driving out of the grid.



Progression: Add passive pressure from a defender who closes the player as they turn.





Decision-Making Drill: Two Options







Setup: Create a 20x15-meter rectangle divided into two halves with small goals or target players at each end. Place a mannequin or cone 5 meters from the midpoint.





Execution:





The striker starts in front of the mannequin (simulating a defender) and drops deep when the ball is played.



A coach or partner plays the ball to the striker.



If the defender (mannequin) "stays," the striker turns and drives into space to finish on goal.



If the defender "follows," the striker plays a first-time layoff to a supporting teammate or spins into the open space.



Coaching Points: Timing of the drop, body positioning to protect the ball, and quick decisions.





Finishing Drill: Turn and Shoot







Setup: Use the penalty area with a goalkeeper and a feeder outside the box.



Execution:





The striker receives the ball on the edge of the box with their back to goal.



Perform a turn and take a shot within two touches.



Progression: Add a defender to increase difficulty.



Coaching Points: Focus on timing, turning into space, and accurate finishing.





Finishing Drill: Turn and Shoot 2







Setup (Pink Zone in the Diagram): Use the penalty area with a goalkeeper and a feeder outside the box.



Execution:





The striker receives the ball on the edge of the box with their back to goal.



Perform a turn and take a shot within two touches.



Progression: Add a defender to increase difficulty.



Coaching Points: Focus on timing, turning into space, and accurate finishing.





Decision-Making Drill: Turning and Linking







Setup: Use the final third . Coach plays player who has mannequin or cone to their back.  Drill shows a second finish if you have another player, but this is not required if not.



Execution:





The striker receives the ball under pressure, shields it, and decides between:





Laying it back to the coach (pr off to a nearby teammate).



Turning to create space for a shot.



Holding the ball longer to allow time for more support.



Coaching Points: Focus on body positioning, quick decisions, and effective communication.





Finishing Drill: Hold-Up to Goal







Setup: Use the final third with a goal and goalkeeper.



Execution:





The striker receives the ball with their back to goal, shields it from a defender, and executes one of the following:





A quick turn and shot.



A pass back to the coach for a one-two before finishing.



Progression: Add a defender to increase difficulty.

Finishing Exercise: 1v1 Finishing







Setup: Use the penalty box and two goals as per the diagram.   The game in the box can be a 1v1 or 2v2, with the remaining players places around the edge of the box.



Execution:





One player/team attacks and the other defends. If the game is 2v2 then only one player can receive the ball on a team.



The attacking player/team get 5 shots/balls before their turn is over.



After this point, another two players/teams enter the field to replace the defending and attacking teams, who take their place.



Double movements are the key to this game. Fake to get a ball from one player and explode to another to receieve/finish.



Progression: Reduce the strikers to 2 touch, meaning their turning and movement is key.





Finishing Exercise: 1v1 Game







Setup: Split the pitch into 4 boxes (or more/less to suit the numbers) and your players into 3 teams.  Each box should be a 1v1 and a bounce player in the corner - one player from each team in each box.  Players are not allowed out of their box.   



Execution:





Game starts from one corner, with one team starting as the attacking team.   The attacking team needs to make 5 passes before they can score.



If there is a turnover of possession then the other team has a chance to make 5 passes and score.  If the ball goes out of play, the game restarts from a different corner player.



When a team successfully scores, the team who concedes becomes the corner team.



Progression: Remove the squares and play a bigger game.





Positional Drill: Turning in the Final Third







 Setup: 3 different games in a small setup across the middle of the pitch.





Game 1:  Blacks score in the goals after x passes.  Blues win and dribble through a gate



Game 2:  Black plays to black, who has back to defender.  Black receives, turns and drives through gate.  If blue wins, they drive through gates



Game 3:  Wide goal game



Coaching Points: Emphasize timing, communication, and decision-making.





Positional Drill: Turning in the Final Third







 Setup: Final 3rd 1v1 Drill with one bigh goal and goalkeeper, and two mini goals



Execution:





Ball 1:  Goalkeeper passes to player 1 and upon this pass, player 2 sprints out and defends 1v1 against player 1.



Ball 2:  As soon as this phase ends, player 2 retreats to the edge of the box to receive a pass from player 3.  Player 4 must defend.   However, player 4 can come onto the pitch to defend as soon as the phase of play from ball 1 ends, meaning that they will be behind player 2, who has to turn, escape pressure, and finish.



If the defender or goalkeeper win the ball at any point, they can score in the minigoals.



Coaching Points: Emphasize timing, communication, and decision-making.





Positional Drill: Hold Up Play and Turning







Setup: 7 aside game with 3 zones.  Only a Striker and Defender are allowed in the end zones.



Execution:





The Striker (S) can score in the big goals against the goalkeeper.  



The Defender (D) can score in the mini goals.



As soon as the ball goes into an end zone, the coach fires another ball into the middle to keep things flowing (and stop the players from being bored).   



Coaching Points: Timing of runs, communication, and exploiting space in the channels.
