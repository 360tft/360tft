Section Introduction

Running across defenders is a critical skill for strikers, as it disrupts defensive organization and creates opportunities to exploit spaces. By crossing a defender’s path, a striker forces them to make decisions—whether to follow the run, switch markers or stay in position—all of which can lead to confusion and mistakes. 

This movement also makes it harder for defenders to keep track of both the ball and the striker, creating openings for through balls, crosses, or quick finishes. Mastering this technique not only enhances a striker's goal-scoring potential but also adds a dynamic edge to the team’s attacking play.

As the defenders must try and see YOU and the BALL, it allows you the perfect opportunity to make a (blind side) run in-between players, to receive the ball. The first time the defender sees you is when the ball is played past him! The key to this run is timing!



In the video above, you can see the master of timing his run across defenders and into their blindspot, Erling Haaland.

Running Across Defenders





Another player who excels at identifying when to run across defenders and into their blindspot is Jamie Vardy.  As you can see from the image, Vady reads the body language of his team mate (who has time on the ball and his eyes up) so knows when and where to run.  He does not fill the space he wants to attack too early or run into the space when his teammate is looking at the ball under pressure.

Why Running Across Defenders is Essential for a Striker

Running across defenders is a highly effective skill for strikers that can unsettle even the most organized defensive lines. By forcing defenders to adjust their focus and coordination, you create opportunities for yourself and your team. Here’s why it’s a crucial tool in a striker’s arsenal and how to execute it effectively:



1. Disrupting Defensive Focus

When you make a run across a defensive line, you force defenders to switch their marking responsibilities or make quick decisions about whether to track your movement. This momentary hesitation can lead to:





Miscommunication between defenders.



Disrupted defensive shape, creating space for teammates.



Delayed reactions that give you the edge to get on the ball.



2. Exploiting Blind Spots

Defenders constantly try to keep both the ball and their opponent in sight. By running across their line of vision or behind their shoulder (on the blind side), you make it harder for them to track you effectively.





The blind-side run is particularly potent because the first time the defender notices you may be when it’s too late—when the ball is already past them, and you're in on goal.



This type of run is best utilized when combined with quick, precise passes from your teammates.





A useful unopposed practice for strikers to link play and then run into a defenders blindspot to get on the end of a cross or through ball.



3. Creating Space for Yourself and Others

Running across defenders can also open up gaps for other players to exploit. For example:





As you move across the line, you can drag one or more defenders out of position, creating space in the middle or behind for your teammates to exploit.



This movement forces the defence to shift laterally, increasing the chances of a mistake or leaving another attacking player unmarked.



4. Timing is Everything

The effectiveness of running across defenders hinges on impeccable timing. Key factors include:





Starting Your Run: Move just as the ball carrier is preparing to play the pass, ensuring you’re in the right position to receive it.



Staying Onside: Watch the defensive line and adjust your run to avoid being caught offside while maximizing the distance from your marker.



Acceleration: A sudden burst of pace across the defender can make all the difference, particularly in tight spaces.



5. Examples of Running Across Defenders





Diagonal Runs: Starting from the wing or edge of the box and cutting across the centre backs to attack the goal.



Inside-to-Outside Runs: Moving across the defensive line toward the far post, particularly effective during crosses.



Support Runs: Crossing the defender’s line of vision to receive a pass at the top of the box or in the channel.





This goal by Ollie Watkins in the World Cup Semi Finals is a great example of him running into the left centre backs (Van Dijk) blindspot and across the right centre backs line of vision.   Timing and acceleration are everything.



6. Practice Makes Perfect

To master this skill, focus on:





Small-Sided Games: Play in tight spaces to improve your timing and quick decision-making.



Passing Drills: Work with teammates to refine the timing and precision of runs and passes.



Video Analysis: Study strikers like Jamie Vardy, who is known for his perfectly timed runs across defenders.



Running across defenders is not just about athleticism; it’s about intelligence, timing, and understanding the game. 

Mastering this movement can elevate your game, making you a constant threat and a nightmare for defenders to handle.

How To Run Across Defenders - The Key Points

Running across defenders is a vital skill for strikers, enabling them to disrupt defensive lines, create space, and exploit goal-scoring opportunities. This movement forces defenders to make quick decisions—whether to track the run, switch marking, or hold their position—which often leads to confusion and mistakes. By effectively running across defenders, strikers can gain positional advantage, receive the ball in dangerous areas, and keep defenders on the back foot. Mastering this technique enhances a striker’s ability to score and opens up spaces for teammates, making it a key element in any forward’s arsenal.

Here are the key points for executing this key skill.



1. Awareness and Scanning





Key Point: The striker must frequently scan their surroundings before making a run across defenders to assess the position of defenders, spaces, and the ball.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to develop the habit of scanning both the ball carrier and the defensive line to anticipate opportunities.



Practice Scenario: Set up passing drills where the striker must identify defenders’ positions (marked by cones or players) before initiating their run.



2. Timing the Run





Key Point: The striker must time their run to stay onside while creating separation from the defender at the critical moment.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to delay their movement until the ball carrier is ready to pass, then make a quick, sharp run across the defender’s path.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where the striker must time their run to meet the ball just as it is played into their path.





This is a goal scored in a Champions League Final, with Crespo running across one defender into anothers blindspot.  Crespo was not a quick player but the timing of his runs was a great asset.

You may not coach/play at the above level, but we would really encourage you to encourage your strikers to make these runs, even if you are coaching young players who do not need to worry about offsides.   Leaving a static striker up front may lead to goals and wins at a young age, but as soon as the offside rule is introduced at 11 aside, this bad habit will not lead to success.



3. Reading the Defender





Key Point: Strikers must read the defender’s body orientation and positioning to decide the best angle and timing for their run.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to exploit a defender’s blind side or move when the defender’s focus is on the ball, not the runner.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 drills with defenders tasked to track the striker, focusing on exploiting moments of defensive hesitation.



4. Angling the Run





Key Point: The run should be angled to cut across the defender, forcing them to adjust their position and lose momentum.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to make diagonal runs that intersect the defender’s path, giving them an advantage when receiving the ball.



Practice Scenario: Undertaking a practice that is just constant repetition of movement and finishing will help with this.







5. Body Positioning to Receive the Ball





Key Point: After running across a defender, the striker must position their body to protect the ball and be ready for their next action.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to use their body to shield the ball from defenders and to open up their stance to face the goal.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where defenders apply light pressure as the striker receives the ball, focusing on shielding and turning.



6. First Touch





Key Point: A purposeful first touch is essential to maintain momentum and capitalize on the space created by the run.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to take their first touch into space, away from the defender, or toward goal.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills with varied angles and speeds, requiring the striker to adjust their first touch to different situations.



7. Decision-Making





Key Point: After receiving the ball, strikers must quickly decide whether to shoot, pass, or dribble based on the position of defenders and teammates.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to assess their options before receiving the ball, and preparing for their next move.



Practice Scenario: Use small-sided games where the striker must make quick decisions under defensive pressure.







8. Communication





Key Point: Strikers should signal their intent to teammates by calling for the ball or using gestures to indicate their movement.



Coaching Tip: Encourage verbal and non-verbal communication to ensure the ball carrier knows the striker’s plan.



Practice Scenario: Run combination play drills where strikers must signal their run across defenders before the ball is played.





A non verbal cue can help the player on the ball.



9. Exploiting Defensive Weaknesses





Key Point: Running across defenders often disrupts the defensive line, creating space for other attackers or drawing defenders out of position.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to recognize defensive disorganization and adjust their run to exploit gaps.



Practice Scenario: Use 3v3 drills with defenders tasked to hold their line, while the striker practices runs to create space for teammates.





The defender in the image is focused on the ball ("ball watching") and is unaware of the run being made behind him.  Instead of a straight run that may be matched by the other defender, the striker is intelligent and runs away from this player and into the blindspot of the ball watching defender.



10. Transitioning After Receiving the Ball





Key Point: Once the striker receives the ball, they must transition quickly to maintain the attack’s momentum, whether by taking a shot or playing a decisive pass.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to focus on the next action immediately after controlling the ball, avoiding hesitation.



Practice Scenario: Set up finishing drills where the striker receives a pass after running across a defender, then takes a quick shot or lays off the ball.



11. Fitness and Acceleration





Key Point: Running across defenders effectively requires sharp bursts of acceleration to create separation and maintain advantage.



Coaching Tip: Incorporate sprint drills into training to improve the striker’s explosive speed and recovery time.



Practice Scenario: Use interval sprints followed by finishing drills to replicate the intensity of match situations.



12. Confidence in One-on-One Situations





Key Point: Running across defenders often places the striker in one-on-one situations with the goalkeeper or last defender, requiring confidence to execute.



Coaching Tip: Build confidence through repetition of finishing drills and by emphasizing the importance of calm decision-making in high-pressure moments.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 scenarios where the striker must beat a defender and finish.



Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Running Across Defenders (Players)





Technical Drill: Timing the Run 







Setup: Use the final 3rd with mannequins or cones representing defenders and a coach/partner positioned with the ball.  The main parts of the drill are the run inbehind and the pass from wide.  Alternatively, use a few players/coaches/parents to undertake the whole practice.



Execution:





The player starts on one side of the defender and makes a diagonal run across.



The coach/partner plays a pass as the player completes the run.



The player controls the ball and shoots into the goal.



Progression:





Introduce a passive defender who moves to block the run.





Decision-Making Drill: Reacting to the Passer







Setup: Use half the field with a goal and a goalkeeper. Place two poles or cones to act as gates at the top of the box. A coach or partner plays the ball from midfield.  The diagram shows 2 variations of the drill.



Execution:





Drill 1 - The player comes shorts and bounces the ball with the coach/parent.  As soon as the ball is play back to the coach/parent, the player bends their run in behind the gate to finish in one or two touches.  



Drill 2 - Player starts in between the gates and the coach/parent plays the ball through for the player to finish.  For this drill, you can use two different colours of cones so the coach/parent can call the colour and play the ball to that side for the finish. 



The player must time their run to receive the ball in stride and finish with one or two touches.



Coaching Points: Timing of the run, staying onside, and maintaining composure during the finish.





Finishing Drill: Run Across and Score







Setup: Use the final 3rd with mannequins or cones representing defenders and a coach/partner positioned with the ball.  The main parts of the drill are the player at position 3 making a diagonal run inbehind for the pass from player 2 (blue line).  Alternatively, use a few players/coaches/parents to undertake the whole practice.



Execution:





The player starts from outside the box, makes a curved run across the defenders, and receives a pass in stride.



Finish with one or two touches.



Progression: Add a live defender to simulate pressure.





Game Simulation: Counterattack







Setup: Use half the field with a goal and a goalkeeper. Position a mannequin or cone as a defender(s).



Execution:





The player starts deep and makes a well-timed run in behind as the ball is played from midfield.  This pass can be a direct pass from a coach/parent or involving a bounce pass as shown in the diagram.



The focus is on exploiting space quickly and finishing the counterattack.



Progression: Add a live defender to increase the difficulty.

Finishing Exercise: 1v1 Finishing







Setup: Use the penalty box and two goals as per the diagram.   The game in the box can be a 1v1 or 2v2, with the remaining players places around the edge of the box.



Execution:





One player/team attacks and the other defends. If the game is 2v2 then only one player can receive the ball on a team.



The attacking player/team get 5 shots/balls before their turn is over.



After this point, another two players/teams enter the field to replace the defending and attacking teams, who take their place.



Double movements are the key to this game. Fake to get a ball from one player and explode to another to receieve/finish.



Progression: Reduce the strikers to 2 touch, meaning their movement is key.





Game Scenario: Breakout Finishing







Setup: The game is set up using a rectangle with a rondo grid in the centre, with two teams in the grid. You need 2 full-sized goals, with a goalkeeper in each goal.



Execution:





The game starts with a team in possession, the defending team attempt to win the ball and become the possession team.



Once the possession team get to a number of passes you define, they can play a through pass for the 1vGK finish. Offsides should apply.



Progression 1: pressing player can chase the possession player when attempting to finish the chance.



Progression 2: If the chasing defender wins the ball, they can score for a point.





Game Scenario: Breaking Down a Defence







Setup: Use two-thirds of the pitch. Set up an 7v7+1 game with full-size goals and a 2-man defense for each team.



Execution:





Encourage strikers to pull onto the other CB (one not marking them) and run in behind when the team has possession.



Focus on midfielders and wingers supporting these movements with through balls or overlapping runs.



Coaching Points: Recognize when to make a diagonal run, effective use of wingers, and communication between the striker and midfielders.





Positional Drill: In Behind Movement







Setup: 7 aside game with 3 zones.  Only a Striker and Defender are allowed in the end zones.



Execution:





The Striker (S) can score in the big goals against the goalkeeper.  



The Defender (D) can score in the mini goals.



As soon as the ball goes into an end zone, the coach fires another ball into the middle to keep things flowing (and stop the players from being bored).   



Coaching Points: Timing of runs, communication, and exploiting space in the channels.
