Section Introduction 

Attacking crosses is one of the most crucial skills a striker can master. Crosses offer unique opportunities to break through defensive lines and capitalise on well-placed deliveries from wide areas. Whether it’s a lofted cross, a driven low ball, or a cutback from the byline, strikers must understand how to position themselves, time their runs, and finish with precision. 

This section provides a comprehensive look at why attacking crosses is pivotal, the techniques required, and structured training sessions to improve this skill.

Strikers who excel at attacking crosses add a new dimension to their team’s attack, making them unpredictable and harder to defend against. The key lies in understanding the nuances of different types of crosses and developing the movements and techniques to finish them effectively.

Why Attacking Crosses is Crucial for a Striker

Attacking crosses is vital for strikers because wide areas often provide some of the best goal-scoring opportunities. Here are several reasons why it’s an essential skill:





High-Percentage Scoring Opportunities
Crosses create close-range scoring chances, often with minimal defensive pressure compared to shots taken from outside the box. The proximity to goal increases the likelihood of converting chances into goals.



Exploiting Defensive Weaknesses
Crosses stretch defences horizontally, forcing defenders to cover more ground and make decisions about marking assignments. This often leads to gaps and miscommunications, which strikers can exploit.





Both of the Newcastle centre backs have been attracted to the crosser, leaving a gap that Chris Woods has exploited.



Creating Aerial Duels
For physically dominant or taller strikers, crosses offer an opportunity to outmuscle defenders and win headers. Even against well-organised defences, aerial ability can create chaos and second-ball opportunities.



Unpredictable Attacking Patterns
Crosses diversify a team’s attack. When combined with central play, they make the striker’s movements harder to predict, forcing defenders to constantly adjust.



Leveraging Team Play
A striker who effectively attacks crosses builds trust with their wide players. Wingers and full-backs are more likely to deliver consistent crosses if they see the striker actively engaging and finishing their efforts.



Counteracting Deep Defences
Against teams that sit deep, crosses provide a direct route to goal. Low-driven balls and cutbacks, in particular, can bypass compact defences that clog central areas.



Maximising Possession
Teams that dominate possession often rely on wide play to create breakthroughs. A striker’s ability to attack crosses ensures that possession turns into productive chances.



Psychological Impact on Opponents
A striker who consistently attacks crosses forces defenders and goalkeepers to constantly be on alert. This can lead to hesitations, mistakes, and defensive lapses.

Strikers who ignore wide play miss out on a significant number of opportunities. By understanding and mastering the art of attacking crosses, they can dramatically increase their goal-scoring potential and overall effectiveness.

How to Attack Crosses - The Key Points

1. Reading the Cross

Strikers must develop the ability to read the crosser’s body language, positioning, and momentum. For example:





A winger with an open body might deliver a lofted cross.



A winger cutting inside may play a driven or cut-back ball. Anticipating the type of cross allows the striker to prepare their movement and finish accordingly.



2. Timing the Run

Timing is critical in attacking crosses:





For lofted crosses, strikers should wait until the ball is airborne before attacking the space.



For low-driven crosses, strikers should arrive as the ball enters the box. Strikers can use double movements or delayed runs to disrupt defenders’ marking patterns.





The first defender is taught to position themselves in line with the crosser, protecting the front post area.  You see the first defender running back to protect this space in the image.

The second defender is tasked with covering the back post and reacting to the cross.

Knowing this defensive setup is crucial for attackers to find and exploit space effectively.

The attacker  holds his run and assesses the movements of the first defender.

If the space in the 6-yard box is available, attack it as the cross is happening.

If it's not available, put on the brakes and look for opportunities in the second 6-yard box, or at the front post as the cross is delivered.





3. Positioning Based on the Cross

Different types of crosses require distinct positioning:





Near-Post Runs: Attack quickly to beat defenders and meet early crosses.



Far-Post Runs: Target lofted or late crosses.



Penalty Spot Positioning: Stay central for cutbacks or rebounds.





A common scenario during crossing situations is forward players trying to fill the space they want to attack too early. They often end up beyond the width of the posts, in a static situation, making scoring a goal very difficult.

You can see above that a player is beyond the front post and if they wanted to attack this space, they should be in the highlighted zone beside the penalty spot.



4. Movement in the Box

Strikers should vary their runs:





Use curved runs to stay onside and generate momentum.



Employ double movements to fake one direction before cutting back to another.



Drift into blind-side positions, making it harder for defenders to track their run.

The movement also opens up space for others.





Wide midfielders on the opposite flank should read the striker's run and adjust their movement to attack the space the striker has opened up.



5. Body Orientation

Maintain an open stance to the ball to react quickly and finish effectively. For headers, keep the neck firm and aim downward. For volleys, ensure balance and proper body alignment.



6. Composure and Finishing

Strikers must stay composed under pressure. The focus should be on clean contact rather than power, especially in high-pressure moments.



7. Communication

Effective communication with wide players ensures consistency in crossing and finishing. Strikers should signal their preferred runs and positions during attacks.

Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Attacking Crosses (for Players)





Finishing Drill: Timing and Movement for High Crosses







Setup:  Use the final third of a pitch and use mannequin or cones to simulate defenders.  Your parent or coach will need to deliver the crosses.  This exercise can be done with a minimum of 2 players - adjust the sequence/work one side at a time to suit.  However, you need to retain the part of the exercise where the striker receives the cross to finish (blue line).



Drill:





The striker starts outside the penalty box.



As the winger prepares to cross, the striker times their run into the box.



Focus on attacking near-post, central, and far-post areas alternately.



Objective: Practise timing, movement, and heading technique for lofted crosses.



Progression: Add a passive defender to simulate real-game challenges.





Finishing Drill: Low-Driven Crosses







Setup:  Use the final third of a pitch and use mannequin or cones to simulate defenders.  Your parent or coach will need to deliver the crosses.  This exercise can be done with a minimum of 2 players - adjust the sequence/work one side at a time to suit.  However, you need to retain the part of the exercise where the striker receives the cross to finish.   Use cones to mark the penalty spot and front-post area. A coach or winger delivers low-driven crosses.



Drill:





Striker positions themselves just outside the penalty box.



On the coach’s cue, the striker sprints into the box to meet the cross.



Practise first-time finishes using the instep or laces.



Objective: Develop quick reactions and clean contact on low crosses.



Progression: Add a rebound element where the striker must react to deflected or missed crosses.





Finishing Exercise: Receiving Under Pressure To Finish







Setup: Use the final third of a pitch and use mannequin or cones to simulate a defender.  This exercise can be done with a minimum of 2 players - adjust the sequence/work one side at a time to suit.  However, you need to retain the part of the exercise where the striker receives the cross to finish.



Execution:





Follow the pass and movement sequences indicated in the diagram.



Diagram shows two different sequences for finishing.



Player practices receiving the ball from a cross and finishing in one or two touches.



Coaching Point:  Hit the target with the finish and use a variety of finishes depending on the angle you are at.





Finishing Exercise: Finishing Deflected Crosses







Setup: Use the final third of a pitch and use mannequin or cones to simulate defenders that will defelct the cross.  This exercise can be done with a minimum of 2 players - adjust the sequence/work one side at a time to suit.  However, you need to retain the part of the exercise where the striker receives the cross to finish.



Execution:





Your coach/parent will deliver a low cross, purposely hitting the cones/mannequin so the ball deflects.



The player will time their run into the second six yard box, adjusting to receive the ball after the deflection.



Player practices receiving the ball from a cross and finishing in one or two touches.



Player then sprints around the farside cones/mannequin to receive the second cross and finish at the back post.



Coaching Point:  Hit the target with the finish and use a variety of finishes depending on the angle you are at.





Finishing Drill: Reacting to Cutbacks







Setup: Players can get 3 different finishes in this exercises.  If you only have a parent helper, then they can deliver all three passes in sequence.   Replace mannequins with cones if you do not have any.



Drill:





Blue line: Pull back off the defender, receive the cutback, touch the ball out of your feet, and finish.



Black line: Striker makes a move across the defender to receive the low driven cross to finish.



Green line: Striker makes a movement from deep to attack the deep cross and finish.



Objective: Practise positioning, balance, and one-touch finishing from cutbacks and crosses.



Progression: Add a defender to increase pressure and realism.





Finishing Drill: Quick Reactions







Setup: You will need a rebounder or coach to exchange passes with, and someone to feed high balls to attack at the back post.



Execution: 





The player exchanges passes with a rebounder or coach to simulate a rebound/loose ball breaking to them in the box.   Player must adjust their body to get the ball under control and finish within 2 touches.



In the second phase, the player makes a movement to the backpost to attack a throw from the coach/parent and head the ball into the net from close range.



Key Focus: Quick decision-making and body adjustment.





Finishing Drill: Reacting to Cutbacks 2







Setup: Use a winger positioned near the byline to deliver cutbacks. Place a mannequin to simulate a defender.



Drill:





The striker starts near the penalty spot.



As the cutback is delivered, the striker adjusts their position to shoot with one touch.



Objective: Practise positioning, balance, and one-touch finishing from cutbacks.



Progression: Add a defender to increase pressure and realism.



Team Session Plans to Help Teach Attacking Crosses (for Coaches)





Finishing Drill: Cross-and-Finish Circuit







Setup: Divide players into groups of attackers, wingers, and defenders. Use a full-size pitch or wide area.



Drill:





This unopposed practice can be run with a minimum of 5 players and a maximum of a full squad.



Set the players up as shown in the diagram. The game begins with Player A, who plays a pass to Player B.



Upon this pass, Player A begins an underlapping forward run into the space shown by the dotted line.



Player B then plays Player C, who plays the ball into the space for Player A to run onto.



Player C then crosses for the strikers to run onto and finish.



Once the sequence is over, the same sequence takes place on the opposite side of the pitch (if applicable).



Wide players will follow their pass for the rotation (A to B, B to C, C to A) and the strikers will rotate (if applicable).



Coaching Points: 





The angle, weight, and timing of passes are all key. The attack should keep flowing and players should not stop to receive passes at any point.



Players should really drive past the mannequin to practice committing defenders during a game.



The overlapping run should be well timed to avoid offside.



Hit the target with the finish and use a variety of finishes depending on the angle you are at.



Players should always follow in for rebounds.



If we can find a teammate facing forward, we need runs in behind





Finishing Drill: Cross-and-Finish Circuit 2







Setup: Divide players into groups of attackers, wingers, and passers. Use a full-size final 3rd.



Drill:





This unopposed practice can be run with a minimum of 5 players and a maximum of a full squad.



Set the players up as shown in the diagram. The game begins with Player 1, who plays a pass to Player, who bounces back.



Upon this pass, Player 3 makes a forward run into the space shown by the dotted line.



This is the signal for player 4 to make his double movement into the box.



Player 3 then crosses for the striker to run onto and finish.  Player 3 should aim for the second 6 yard box area.



Player 4 finishes in 1 or 2 touches.



Player 4 then runs to the yellow cone at the top of the box, touches it, and sprints back into the second 6 yard box for a pass from player 5 for another finish.



All players follow their pass (1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.).



As soon as green is done, blue will begin the same sequence on the opposite side.



Coaching Points: 





The angle, weight, and timing of passes are all key. The attack should keep flowing and players should not stop to receive passes at any point.



The runs should be well timed to avoid offside.



Hit the target with the finish and use a variety of finishes depending on the angle you are at.



Players should always follow in for rebounds.



If we can find a teammate facing forward, we need runs in behind to cross.





Finishing Drill: Cross-and-Finish Circuit 3 (opposed)







Setup: Divide players into groups of attackers, wingers, and defenders. Use the final third.



Drill:





Blue Line





Player A should start a run forward and receive on the move from Player B. Player A then finishes in the mini goal.



Red Line





As soon as Player A releases the ball towards the mini goal, Player C passes into space for Player D to run onto, receive and cross for Player A and B, who make runs into the box.



Progression: Ask Player A to recover and defend the cross against Player B.



Black Line





As soon as the above breaks down, Player A passes to Player F, who spins and attacked the goal. Players A and B need to recover and defend.



If a defender or Goalkeeper win the ball at any point, they can score in the mini goals.



Rotation from A to B, B to E, E to F, F to C, C to D, and D to A.



Coaching Points: 





Blue Line





Player A: Time your run so you are coming onto the ball. Complete the finish first before thinking about defending. Transition to defending as soon as the ball leaves your foot.



Player B: Start your forward run as soon as the ball leaves your foot.



Red Line





Player C: Select the correct weight of pass.



Player D: Touch the ball in front, glance at the attackers runs, back and the ball, and then deliver. Mix up your deliveries (driven, high cross, etc.).



Players A and B: Mix up your runs (Near post / Far post) and make double runs. Attack the ball.



Black Line





Player F: Scan to see where players A and B are. If they are recovering then minimise the minimising the number of steps between your setup touch and shot. If they are deep, can you run with the ball and open up a better angle.





Finishing Drill: Lose Your Width



All exercises should be done the same phase, then players follow their initial pass (Black Line) to rotate positions.





Setup: All exercises should be done the same phase, then players follow their initial pass (Black Line) to rotate positions.



Execution:





Black Line



The exercise starts with player (O), who passes to (1), who plays into (2).



This is the cue for movement as (2) is facing forward. (4) is in the shadow of the defender, they then move across the defender to set (3).



This is the cue for a diagonal run from wide. (3) then plays (5), who has run in behind the defender to finish.



Red Line



After the shot from (5), they should make an aggressive run across the cone to finish from a pass from (6).



Blue Line



Same setup as first exercise (black line) but when the ball is played to (2), (3) makes a deep run diagonally to receive a reverse pass from (2) and finish.



Coaching Points: If you receive on the touchline in the final third, good teams will shift across and shut you down, forcing you back. Lose your width instead and play on the outside of their shape.





Simulated Match Play with Crossing Focus







Setup: Set up a small-sided game (8v8) with an emphasis on wide play and crossing.



Drill:





Encourage full backs to deliver crosses as soon as they reach wide areas.



Strikers and midfielders focus on making coordinated runs into the box.



Objective: Develop team coordination in wide play and finishing from crosses.



Progression: Introduce restrictions, such as mandatory crossing after three passes in wide areas.  Remove the small goals and replace with full sized goals.





Finishing Drill: Cutback Finishing







Setup: Divide players into two teams. Mark zones for wide players to cut back the ball from (in the "Assist Zone").



Drill:





Set up the practice as seen above. Note that the diagrams are mirrored for clarity purposes and both blue and green should start at the same time.



You will required 12+ outfield players for this exercise, plus 2 goalkeepers. The players should be split into 2 teams, as shown.



The game starts with the A player from each team running around the mannequin as shown.



When the A player is almost at the mannequin, their teammate, the B player, should feed them the ball to shoot.



If the A payer scores in one touch, they get 3 points for their team, if they take more than 1 touch and score, they get 1 point.



The first team to 21 points wins the game.



Once A has finished their chance, they collect the ball and join the B players queue. B join a A players queue.



After a set time, swap the positions of the queues around so players are working each foot.



Coaching Points: 





Player A





Time your movement so you are coming onto the ball, don't attack the space too early.



A composed sidefoot finish is best from close range.



Open your body and use disguise to shoot.

Player B





Assess Player A’s run and pass the ball in front of them.



Use your side foot to pass firmly.



Pass the ball to player A’s backfoot to give them a chance of scoring first time.



Progression: If a player scores a first-time volley or header (age 16+ player only), the team gets 5 points.
