Section Introduction 

As mentioned in the introduction to this section, creating space and disrupting defences are key attributes for strikers to learn.  Forcing defenders into difficult decisions through clever movement gives them a problem.  

For example, dropping deep leaves your defender with two choices; 





Do they leave you? If so, this will leave you with space, this is a great opportunity to get the ball to your feet and get turned.



Do they follow and get tight? If so, this will leave space behind them for a teammate to run into or for you to spin into.



The video above shows the impact of dropping deep. In each clip, the striker dropping deep presented the defenders with a headache, as per the 2 problems listed above.  Watch it and take the below points into consideration when you do.

Dropping Deep: A Tactical Advantage for Strikers





In this clip, we can see that Olise has dropped off the front line, leaving space behind for Mateta to run into for a through ball.   Movement can be as simple as this.

Creating space and disrupting defenders are essential skills for any striker aiming to be effective. Clever movement, particularly the act of dropping deep, forces defenders into difficult decisions and gives strikers a strategic edge. 

Here’s why it’s such an important tool:





Forcing Decisions on Defenders
When a striker drops deep, they present defenders with a dilemma:





Do they leave you?
If the defender decides not to follow, it creates space for you to operate. This is an excellent opportunity to receive the ball to feet, turn, and drive at the defence. From this position, you can link up with teammates, play incisive passes, or take shots from distance.



Do they follow and get tight?
If the defender chooses to track your movement, it opens up valuable space behind them. This space can be exploited by a teammate making a well-timed run or by yourself through a quick spin into the vacated area.



For both of these dilemmas, scanning and awareness of what the defender is doing is really important.   



Link-Up Play and Team Dynamics
Dropping deep also allows strikers to connect with midfielders, acting as a bridge between midfield and attack. By coming closer to the ball, strikers can hold up play, bring others into the game, and set the tempo for forward movements.



Unpredictability in Attack
By varying your movements—dropping deep at times, staying high, or running in behind—you keep defenders guessing. This unpredictability makes it harder for them to settle into a rhythm and increases the chances of defensive errors.



Dragging Defenders Out of Position
When defenders step out to follow a striker dropping deep, it can disrupt the entire defensive line. This disorganization creates opportunities for teammates to exploit, whether through overlapping runs from wide players or central midfielders driving into the box.



Creating Overloads in Midfield
By dropping into midfield, strikers can help create numerical superiority in key areas. This overload forces the opposition to adjust, which can leave spaces elsewhere on the pitch. Teams that play possession-based football can particularly benefit from this added option in midfield.





Drawing Fouls in Dangerous Areas
Operating in the space between the opposition's midfield and defence increases the likelihood of being fouled, especially when defenders are forced into awkward positions. These fouls can lead to dangerous free-kick opportunities or disrupt the opposition's defensive shape.

Pro Tip

When dropping deep, ensure you’re aware of your surroundings and maintain a clear picture of where your teammates are positioned. Quick decision-making and sharp turns are key to making this movement effective. 

Watching players like Harry Kane and Karim Benzema, who excel at dropping deep and linking play, can provide valuable insights into mastering this skill.

How To Drop Deep - The Key Points

To become a master at dropping deep, you need to understand the key points.  These apply whether you are learning (players) or teaching (coaches).  The session plans below will encourage players to practice these key points:

1. Awareness and Scanning





Key Point: The striker must scan their surroundings frequently before and after dropping deep to assess space, defenders, and teammates' positions.



Coaching Tip: Encourage a “check your shoulder” habit before receiving the ball to identify pressure and options.



Practice Scenario: Introduce a constraint in your rondos so if a player scans before receiving they can have unlimited touches, but if they don't, they can only take one touch.





You can see in the above clip than Kane drops off and Son runs in behind.  Kane is fully aware of this run and can play the ball into Son's path.

Kane's clever movement dropping deep has opened up space for a teammate.



2. Timing of the Drop





Key Point: The timing of the drop is crucial to avoid being too early (allowing defenders to adjust) or too late (losing the opportunity).



Coaching Tip: Strikers should begin their drop just as the ball carrier looks ready to pass. This creates separation from their marker.



Practice Scenario: Introduce a practice where a striker needs to time their movement away from a defender (or mannequin or cone) to link play with teammates or a coach.





3. Body Positioning





Key Point: The striker should position their body to shield the ball and face the play, keeping defenders on their back.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to open their body slightly when receiving the ball, allowing them to pivot or lay off a pass quickly.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 drills where the striker receives the ball under pressure and must hold off the defender while making their next decision.



4. Receiving the Ball





Key Point: The first touch should be purposeful, either to control and protect the ball or set up the next action (e.g., pass or turn).



Coaching Tip: Focus on the quality of the first touch—encourage strikers to take their touch away from pressure or toward space.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills with a feeder playing the ball at different speeds and angles, forcing the striker to adjust and control effectively.





This session lets strikers recieve the ball at different angles and scenarios, and is an excellent practice for angles to receieve and decision-making.



5. Decision-Making





Key Point: The striker must decide quickly whether to hold the ball, turn, or pass based on their position and pressure from defenders.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to have a clear idea of their next move before receiving the ball (e.g., turn and play forward, or hold and lay off).



Practice Scenario: Use small-sided games where strikers receive the ball with varying levels of pressure and must decide on the best option within seconds.



6. Communication





Key Point: The striker should communicate clearly with teammates to indicate when and where they want the ball.



Coaching Tip: Use verbal (e.g., calling for the ball) and non-verbal cues (e.g., pointing to space) to direct play.



Practice Scenario: Run a rondo where the striker must signal where they want the ball before receiving it, encouraging communication.





In the image, you can see the striker is leting the player on the ball know where to pass it.   



7. Awareness of Defensive Pressure





Key Point: Strikers need to be aware of the defender’s position and anticipate physical challenges or attempts to intercept.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to feel the defender with their back and use their body to shield the ball effectively.



Practice Scenario: Set up 2v1 drills where the striker receives the ball under pressure and must turn or lay it off while shielding.





This fun game is excellent for introducing defensive pressure in a 2v1 scenario, forcing strikers to make decisions (go alone or link with teammates).



8. Linking with Midfielders





Key Point: The striker must create passing opportunities for teammates and maintain fluidity in the attack.



Coaching Tip: Encourage quick one-twos and lay-offs to midfielders running into space.



Practice Scenario: Run combination play drills where the striker drops deep, lays the ball off to a midfielder, and then makes a secondary run.





Harry Kane is an expert at dropping deep and linking with midfield players so his team can progress the ball.



9. Exploiting Space After Dropping Deep





Key Point: Dropping deep should either create space behind for teammates or allow the striker to turn and drive forward.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to assess the space left behind and exploit it if defenders follow them.



Practice Scenario: Use 4v4 transition drills where the striker drops deep, lays off the ball, and then spins into space for a return pass.



10. Adapting to Defensive Reactions





Key Point: If defenders choose not to follow the striker, they must exploit the time and space to progress play.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to turn and face goal if they are not closely marked. If marked tightly, focus on quick lay-offs.



Practice Scenario: Create situational drills with defenders deciding to follow or stay off, forcing the striker to adjust their decision-making.



11. Transitioning After the Pass





Key Point: After receiving and passing the ball, the striker should reposition quickly to stay involved in the play.



Coaching Tip: Encourage movement into spaces where they can receive the ball again or create a scoring opportunity.



Practice Scenario: Use a passing drill where the striker receives, passes, and immediately moves to receive a second ball in a new position.



12. Physical Strength and Balance





Key Point: Strikers need to be physically strong to shield the ball and maintain balance when under pressure.



Coaching Tip: Include strength training and resistance drills to improve physicality.



Practice Scenario: Run 1v1 shielding drills where defenders try to push the striker off the ball, focusing on balance and control.

Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Dropping Deep (Players)





Technical Drill: Receiving Under Pressure







Setup: Use a small grid (10x10 meters) with a mannequin or cone in the center.



Execution:





Player starts outside the grid and drops deep into the grid.



A coach or partner passes the ball to the player as they drop.



Player practices receiving the ball with their back to goal, turning quickly, and driving out of the grid.



Progression: Add passive pressure from a defender who closes the player as they turn.





Decision-Making Drill: Two Options







Setup: Create a 20x15-meter rectangle divided into two halves with small goals or target players at each end. Place a mannequin or cone 5 meters from the midpoint.





Execution:





The striker starts in front of the mannequin (simulating a defender) and drops deep when the ball is played.



A coach or partner plays the ball to the striker.



If the defender (mannequin) "stays," the striker turns and drives into space to finish on goal.



If the defender "follows," the striker plays a first-time layoff to a supporting teammate or spins into the open space.



Coaching Points: Timing of the drop, body positioning to protect the ball, and quick decisions.





Finishing Drill: Quick Turn and Shot 







Setup: Place a goal 15 meters away from a passing partner and have the striker receive passes with their back to goal.



Execution:





The striker drops deep, receives the ball, turns quickly, and shoots.



Encourage varying the types of turns (inside turn, Cruyff turn, outside turn) and finishing techniques.



Progression: Add a live defender to simulate real-game pressure.



Team Session Plans to Help Teach Dropping Deep (Coaches)




Finishing Exercise: Receiving Under Pressure and Linking Play







Setup: Use the final third of a pitch and us mannequin or cones to simulate a back 4 and midfield 2 (or adjust to suit the level of opponents you face).   This exercise can be done with a minimum of 3 players and maximum of 16 - adjust the sequence/work one side at a time to suit.  However, you need to retain the part of the exercise where the striker drops deep and links play.



Execution:





Follow the pass and movement sequences indicated in the diagram.



Diagram shows two different sequences for finishing.



Player practices receiving the ball with their back to goal and linkiing with a midfielder.



Progression: After pass 3, the striker bends their to run in behind to receieve the ball from the CM to finish.





Finishing Exercise: 1v1 Finishing







Setup: Use the penalty box and two goals as per the diagram.   The game in the box can be a 1v1 or 2v2, with the remaining players places around the edge of the box.



Execution:





One player/team attacks and the other defends. If the game is 2v2 then only one player can receive the ball on a team.



The attacking player/team get 5 shots/balls before their turn is over.



After this point, another two players/teams enter the field to replace the defending and attacking teams, who take their place.



Double movements are the key to this game. Fake to get a ball from one player and explode to another to receieve/finish.



Progression: Reduce the strikers to 2 touch, meaning their movement is key.





Small Sided Drill: 1v1 Game







Setup: Split the pitch into 4 boxes (or more/less to suit the numbers) and your players into 3 teams.  Each box should be a 1v1 and a bounce player in the corner - one player from each team in each box.  Players are not allowed out of their box.   



Execution:





Game starts from one corner, with one team starting as the attacking team.   The attacking team needs to make 5 passes before they can score.



If there is a turnover of possession then the other team has a chance to make 5 passes and score.  If the ball goes out of play, the game restarts from a different corner player.



When a team successfully scores, the team who concedes becomes the corner team.



Progression: Remove the squares and play a bigger game.





Small-Sided Drill: Defenders’ Dilemma







Setup: Use a 40x30-meter area with two small goals at one end and a full-size goal at the other. Divide players into two teams of 8. Assign one striker to each team.



Execution:





The striker practices dropping deep into midfield.



If the defender follows, it creates space behind for teammates to exploit.



Teams score by either combining with the striker or through direct play into the small goals.



Coaching Points: Communication, timing of runs, and recognizing when to drop or stay high.







Positional Game: Creating Space







Setup: Split the pitch into thirds (defensive, midfield, attacking). Use 16 players: 8 attackers and 8 defenders, with a striker in the attacking third.



Execution:





Build attacks starting from the defensive third.



The striker drops deep into the midfield third to create overloads, receiving passes and linking play.



If defenders follow, midfielders exploit space behind with forward runs.



Coaching Points: Movement off the ball, awareness of teammates' positions, and exploiting defensive gaps.







 Game Scenario: Full-Sided Play







Setup: 8v8 match with one striker per team.



Focus: Encourage strikers to drop deep during play and highlight the space created behind for wingers or midfielders to exploit.



Coaching Points: Observe and correct the timing of drops, communication with teammates, and decision-making.
