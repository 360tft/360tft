Section Introduction 

If the opposition defence is playing a high line, therefore leaving you space to run into, making a well-timed run behind can see you go through 1 vs 1 with the goalkeeper! The key to this run is to play as far up the pitch as possible without being offside (on the defender's shoulder) and ready to run onto through balls. 

The golden rule is:





If you are about to receive a diagonal pass, you should make a straight run in behind.



If you are about to receive a straight pass, you should make a diagonal run in behind.



You may not have offsides at 4,5,7, or 9 aside football, but the lessons and key points are still relevant for players of all levels.  You can see in the video of youth football above, all players are trying to stay onside even though the rules allow them to be offside.   These players are practising the requirements of adult football, with a margin of error if they get it wrong.

Running In Behind

Why Running In Behind Defenders is Crucial for a Striker

Running in behind defenders is a fundamental skill that every striker must master. It is a direct and highly effective way to exploit space, create goal-scoring opportunities, and keep defenders constantly on edge. Here’s why it’s so important and how you can maximize its impact.



1. Exploiting High Defensive Lines

When the opposition plays a high line, they leave significant space behind their defence. This creates the perfect opportunity for a striker to:





Time their Run: A well-timed run can leave you one-on-one with the goalkeeper, offering a high-percentage chance to score.



Stay on the Shoulder: Playing on the last defender's shoulder allows you to react quickly to through balls while keeping them under pressure.

Key Tip: Stay as high up the pitch as possible without straying offside, constantly scanning for the right moment to make your move.





Running in behind is all about timing - both releasing the pass and the run inbehind.   If the pass is played too late, the striker is offside.   If the run is too early, the striker is offside.



2. Forcing Defensive Mistakes

The threat of a run in behind keeps defenders unsettled, making them:





Drop deeper, reducing their ability to press higher up the pitch.



Misjudge the timing of interceptions or challenges, leading to errors.



Commit fouls in dangerous areas, earning free kicks or penalties.

Key Coaching Point: Strikers who consistently make runs in behind force defenders to make decisions under pressure, often leading to gaps or mistakes.



3. Creating Space for Teammates

Your movement in behind doesn’t just benefit you—it can open up opportunities for your team. For example:





Dragging defenders deeper creates space between the defensive and midfield lines for attacking midfielders to exploit.



Runs toward wide areas can stretch the defence, opening gaps for other attackers to drive into.



4. Understanding Pass and Run Combinations

Timing and coordination between the passer and the runner are critical. Use the following principles:





Diagonal Pass = Straight Run: When the ball is played diagonally, your run should remain straight to meet it.



Straight Pass = Diagonal Run: When the ball is played straight, your run should curve or angle to avoid defenders and create a better angle for receiving the ball.

Key Tip: Work on developing a strong connection with your midfielders and wingers so they can anticipate your runs and deliver accurate passes.





This is an example of a diagonal pass needing a straight run from a midfield player.



5. Overcoming Defenders' Strategies

Defenders will try to anticipate and block runs in behind. You can counter this by:





Varying Your Runs: Alternate between running in behind, dropping deep, or pulling wide to keep them guessing.



Using Disguised Movement: Start your run late or feint a move in one direction before accelerating in another.



6. Mental Focus and Patience

Not every run will result in a pass or a goal-scoring opportunity, but persistence is key. Keep making intelligent runs, stay focused, and capitalize when the chance comes.



7. Professional Examples of Running in Behind





Jamie Vardy (Leicester City): Renowned for his explosive runs behind defenders, particularly against high lines.



Erling Haaland (Manchester City): His ability to time runs perfectly and accelerate into space makes him one of the most dangerous strikers in the world.



How To Run In Behind - The Key Points

Running in behind defenders is a game-changing skill that requires timing, patience, and coordination with teammates. Whether exploiting a high line, creating space for others, or forcing mistakes, this movement keeps defenders on the back foot and increases your team’s attacking threat.

If you can master the art of running in behind, you’ll not only increase your goal-scoring opportunities but also become an invaluable asset to your team.  Here are the key points behind mastering this:

1. Awareness and Scanning





Key Point: Strikers must consistently scan their surroundings to assess the defensive line’s positioning, their own teammates’ movements, and the space available behind the defence.



Coaching Tip: Develop a habit of scanning multiple times before making the run to ensure awareness of gaps, defenders, and the ball carrier.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where the striker must call out the position of cones or defenders marked in the defensive line before initiating their run.



2. Timing the Run

Key Point: Perfect timing is critical to staying onside and exploiting the space behind the defence effectively.





Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to delay their run until just before the ball is played, giving defenders less time to react.



Practice Scenario: Use through-ball drills with defenders stepping up to simulate an offside trap, encouraging strikers to make well-timed runs.





You can see the fine lines of offside and how the offside law can be exploiting by players just delaying their run.



3. Reading the Defensive Line





Key Point: Strikers must identify weaknesses in the defensive line, such as gaps between defenders or a lack of communication.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to position themselves on the shoulder of the last defender, making it harder for defenders to track their movement.



Practice Scenario: Use 2v2 drills where the striker focuses on exploiting gaps between defenders.



4. Angling the Run





Key Point: A well-angled run can create separation from defenders and provide a better angle to receive the ball or attack the goal.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to curve their runs to stay onside and approach the ball in a position to shoot or pass effectively.



Practice Scenario: Set up passing drills with angled through balls, requiring the striker to adjust their run to meet the ball at the right angle.



5. Communication





Key Point: Strikers should communicate with the ball carrier to ensure their run is noticed and understood.



Coaching Tip: Encourage clear verbal cues (e.g., “play it early”) and non-verbal gestures (e.g., pointing to space).



Practice Scenario: Use combination play drills where strikers must signal their run before the ball is played.



6. Receiving the Ball on the Run





Key Point: The striker’s first touch should set them up to maintain momentum and control while heading toward the goal.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to use a soft first touch to control the ball into space, or a cushioned touch to prepare for an immediate shot or pass.



Practice Scenario: Run through-ball drills where the striker must receive the ball on the run and quickly transition into an attacking action.





This is a fantastic session to practice receiving the ball on the run and finishing.  As a coach, you should keep increasing the pressure on the striker throughout the drill.



7. Decision-Making





Key Point: After receiving the ball, strikers must quickly decide whether to shoot, pass, or continue driving forward based on the positioning of defenders, teammates, and the goalkeeper.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to assess their options before receiving the ball to reduce hesitation.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 or 2v1 scenarios where the striker must make a quick decision under pressure.



8. Exploiting Space





Key Point: Strikers should identify and target spaces where the defensive line is disorganized or where defenders have been drawn out of position.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to stay patient and wait for the right moment to exploit gaps rather than making runs prematurely.



Practice Scenario: Use small-sided games where defenders rotate, and the striker focuses on targeting gaps in the defensive line.



9. Physical Fitness and Acceleration





Key Point: Running in behind requires explosive speed to outpace defenders and capitalize on through balls.



Coaching Tip: Incorporate sprint drills and interval training to improve acceleration and stamina.



Practice Scenario: Use sprinting drills where the striker starts on the defender’s shoulder and races to meet a pass played in behind.



10. Body Positioning After Receiving the Ball





Key Point: Once the striker receives the ball, they must position their body to shield it from defenders while maintaining control and forward momentum.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to keep their body between the ball and the defender, using their arms and torso for balance and protection.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where defenders apply light pressure, requiring the striker to shield the ball effectively.



11. Offensive Transition





Key Point: After winning the ball back as a team, the striker must transition quickly into an attacking phase, whether by making a run forward or coming to the ball to hold it up.



Coaching Tip: Focus on speed of execution, encouraging strikers to take decisive actions immediately after your team wins the ball.



Practice Scenario: Set up finishing drills where the striker receives a through ball, takes a quick touch, and finishes under pressure.





An unopposed session which contains two finishes after the ball is given away (offensive transition).



12. Confidence in One-on-One Situations





Key Point: Running in behind often leads to one-on-one scenarios with the goalkeeper, requiring composure and confidence to execute effectively.



Coaching Tip: Build confidence through repetition of finishing drills, emphasizing calm decision-making in high-pressure moments.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 scenarios where the striker receives the ball behind the defense and must beat the goalkeeper.



13. Adapting to Defensive Reactions





Key Point: Strikers must be prepared to adjust their run if defenders track their movement or close down the passing lane.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to change direction or delay their run to create a new angle for receiving the ball.



Practice Scenario: Use situational drills with defenders adapting their movements to simulate match conditions, requiring the striker to adjust dynamically.



Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Running In Behind (Players)





Technical Drill: Timing the Run 







Setup: Use the final 3rd with mannequins or cones representing defenders and a coach/partner positioned with the ball.  The main parts of the drill are the run inbehind and the pass from wide.  Alternatively, use a few players/coaches/parents to undertake the whole practice.



Execution:





The player starts on one side of the defender and makes a diagonal run across.



The coach/partner plays a pass as the player completes the run.



The player controls the ball and shoots into the goal.



Progression:





Introduce a passive defender who moves to block the run.





Decision-Making Drill: Adjusting Runs







Setup: Use half the field with a goal and a goalkeeper. Place two poles or cones to act as gates at the top of the box. A coach or partner plays the ball from midfield.  The diagram shows 2 variations of the drill.



Execution:





Drill 1 - The player comes shorts and bounces the ball with the coach/parent.  As soon as the ball is play back to the coach/parent, the player bends their run in behind the gate to finish in one or two touches.  



Drill 2 - Player starts in between the gates and the coach/parent plays the ball through for the player to finish.  For this drill, you can use two different colours of cones so the coach/parent can call the colour and play the ball to that side for the finish. 



The player must time their run to receive the ball in stride and finish with one or two touches.



Coaching Points: Timing of the run, staying onside, and maintaining composure during the finish.





Game Simulation: Counterattack







Setup: Use half the field with a goal and a goalkeeper. Position a mannequin or cone as a defender(s).



Execution:





The player starts deep and makes a well-timed run in behind as the ball is played from midfield.  This pass can be a direct pass from a coach/parent or involving a bounce pass as shown in the diagram.



The focus is on exploiting space quickly and finishing the counterattack.



Progression: Add a live defender to increase the difficulty.

Positional Drill: In Behind Movement







Setup: 7 aside game with 3 zones.  Only a Striker and Defender are allowed in the end zones.



Execution:





The Striker (S) can score in the big goals against the goalkeeper.  



The Defender (D) can score in the mini goals.



As soon as the ball goes into an end zone, the coach fires another ball into the middle to keep things flowing (and stop the players from being bored).   



Coaching Points: Timing of runs, communication, and exploiting space in the channels.





Game Scenario: Breaking Down a Defence







Setup: Use two-thirds of the pitch. Set up an 7v7+1 game with full-size goals and a 2-man defense for each team.



Execution:





Encourage strikers to run in behind when the team has possession.



Focus on midfielders and wingers supporting these movements with through balls or overlapping runs.



Coaching Points: Recognize when to hold wide or make a diagonal run, effective use of wingers, and communication between the striker and midfielders.





Game Scenario: Breakout Finishing







Setup: The game is set up using a rectangle with a rondo grid in the centre, with two teams in the grid. You need 2 full-sized goals, with a goalkeeper in each goal.



Execution:





The game starts with a team in possession, the defending team attempt to win the ball and become the possession team.



Once the possession team get to a number of passes you define, they can play a through pass for the 1vGK finish. Offsides should apply.



Progression 1: pressing player can chase the possession player when attempting to finish the chance.



Progression 2: If the chasing defender wins the ball, they can score for a point.





Technical Exercise: Attack The Space Finishing







Setup: The game is set up between the boxes of the pitch, with two teams at each end. You need 2 goals, with a goalkeeper in each goal, and a healthy supply of balls.



Execution:





Both sides go at the same time and the exercise starts with player A playing a pass in front of player B so B can run onto it.



Player B receives and drives at the mannequin.



Player A then makes an overlapping run around player B and then in behind.



At the right time, player B will play a reverse pass into player A’s path.



Player A will then receive and finish. Players cannot finis beyond a certain point (red zone in the diagram) Player B should follow up for rebound finishes, which can be scored in the red zone.



Progression:  Set a time limit and count the goals each team scores to declare a winnner.





Game Simulation: Pressing and Counter Pressing Game







Setup: The game setup is 2 separate teams, playing 2 different formations, in the highlighted zone.



Execution:





The game always starts from a goalkeeper.  The team in possession must make 5 passes in the zone before they can exit the zone and try to score in the goal they are attacking. Once they attack the goal, the attacker has 7 seconds to score.



Defenders are not allowed to follow a pass that exits the zone.



When an attacker (e.g. Blue Team) goes through on goal and is finished their attempt, a new ball is quickly played to the goalkeeper (e.g. Red Team) so the team has an overload. Attacker has to recover to the zone.



The defenders for the team in possession can drop out of the zone to receive passes (e.g. can go back to receive from the GK and/or drop to switch play), but only passes in the zone count towards the target.



Progression 1: One team has to make 5 passes, and the other can attack the goal as soon as they win it (no minimum passes requirement).

Progression 2: One team only defends with 7 players, the front 3 don’t defend. As soon as the ball is won, the front 3 become involved again.
