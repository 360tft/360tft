Section Introduction 

Pulling wide and running in behind are fundamental movements for modern strikers, as they add unpredictability and versatility to attacking play.  These runs are also called outside-in runs.

By pulling wide, a striker can stretch the defensive line, create space for teammates in central areas, and exploit one-on-one opportunities against fullbacks. 

Running in behind forces defenders to turn toward their own goal, disrupting their shape and opening avenues for through balls or lofted passes. This is because a defender must be able to see (a) the ball and (b) you, the attacker. 

Moving wide into a position when you’re out of their view will cause defenders problems leaving you to exploit the gaps between the opposition full-back and centre-back!  



You can see this in the video above - even in 7 aside football, you can still encourage your strikers to pull wide into defender's blindspot, and make forward runs

These movements not only increase the striker’s goal-scoring chances but also contribute to the team’s overall attacking fluidity, making them essential skills for any forward looking to excel.

Pulling Wide and Running In Behind

Effective movement is a cornerstone of a striker's success, with specific actions like pulling wide and making runs behind defences playing pivotal roles in disrupting opponents and creating scoring opportunities.





The image about highlights how pulling wide and not appearing to be a threat can then be turned into an advantage.   

Even in youth football, this tactic would be one worth teaching strikers as the opposition will often play with a back 2 or 3.  This makes learning this key skill worthwhile as it will have an impact at every level of the game.

Pulling Wide:





Stretching the Defense: By moving towards the flanks, strikers compel central defenders to follow, thereby widening gaps in the defensive line. This lateral movement disrupts the compactness of the defence, making it more susceptible to penetration.



Creating Space for Teammates: Occupying wide areas can draw multiple defenders out of position, opening central channels for midfielders or other attackers to exploit. This tactic enhances team dynamics by facilitating more fluid and unpredictable attacking patterns.



Facilitating Crosses and Cutbacks: Operating from wide positions allows strikers to deliver crosses or cutbacks into the box, increasing the variety and unpredictability of attacking plays. This versatility keeps defenders uncertain and can lead to high-quality scoring chances.





You can see here that player 5 has pulled wide and is waiting for a chance to run in behind and finish.   This player can be any forward player playing at the top end of the park.

Running in Behind Defenses:





Exploiting High Defensive Lines: Well-timed runs behind the defence can capitalize on opponents playing with a high line, leading to one-on-one situations with the goalkeeper. This direct approach often results in clear goal-scoring opportunities



Forcing Defensive Errors: Persistent threats of runs in behind can cause defenders to make hurried decisions, increasing the likelihood of mistakes such as poor clearances or fouls in dangerous areas. This pressure can be instrumental in breaking down organized defences.



Enhancing Verticality in Attack: Forward runs to stretch the field vertically, providing midfielders with options for through balls and encouraging a more dynamic and penetrating offensive approach. This vertical threat keeps defences on the back foot and opens up spaces for combination play.





Southampton's defensive line is so high so Son has timed his run to dart in behind it.

Integrating these movements into a striker's repertoire demands tactical awareness, precise timing, and seamless coordination with teammates. Mastery of pulling wide and running in behind elevates a striker's individual performance and significantly enhances the team's overall attacking potency.

How To Pull Wide and Run In Behind - The Key Points

To become a master at Pulling Wide and Running In Behind, you need to understand the key points. These apply whether you are learning (players) or teaching (coaches). The session plans below will encourage players to practice these key points:

1. Awareness and Scanning





Key Point: Strikers must frequently scan the field before pulling wide or running in behind to assess space, defensive positioning, and teammates’ locations.



Coaching Tip: Develop a habit of scanning during movement to anticipate the play and adapt their run.



Practice Scenario: Use drills where the striker must identify cones or numbers displayed behind them before receiving a pass wide or in behind.



2. Timing of the Run





Key Point: The striker's run must be perfectly timed to avoid offside or arriving too early, giving defenders time to adjust.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to time their run just as the ball is being played to maximize separation from defenders.



Practice Scenario: Set up passing drills where the striker practices starting their run from a marked position, focusing on entering the wide area or running behind at the right moment.





The timing of the run is key.  Especially in adult football, where offside traps will be employed.   It is important to not get excited and run in behind too early, and fill the space you wish to attack.



3. Reading the Defender





Key Point: Strikers must read the defender’s body position and movement to determine the best time and direction to pull wide or run in behind.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to exploit gaps when defenders are flat-footed or focused on the ball.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 drills where the striker observes the defender’s positioning and adjusts their run to create separation.



4. Creating Space





Key Point: Pulling wide should stretch the defensive line, creating space for teammates to exploit centrally. Running in behind should pull defenders out of position.



Coaching Tip: Strikers should combine wide runs with decoy movements to disrupt the defensive structure.



Practice Scenario: Set up 3v3 attacking drills where strikers alternate between pulling wide and running in behind, focusing on creating space for others.





Messi was the master of playing 1-2's around the box.  The key is to never stop moving when the ball is moving as this pulls defenders out of position.



5. Body Positioning to Receive the Ball





Key Point: When pulling wide or running in behind, strikers should position their body to shield the ball from defenders and allow for quick turns or lay-offs.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to receive on their back foot with an open body to face the play immediately.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where the striker receives the ball near the sideline or on the run, focusing on body orientation and quick transitions.






In this individual exercise, you can focus on your body shape to receive and your first touch.



6. First Touch





Key Point: A controlled first touch is critical for setting up the next action, whether turning to attack or playing a pass to a teammate.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to direct their first touch into space or away from pressure.



Practice Scenario: Set up drills with passes played to strikers in wide positions, emphasizing first-touch control and decision-making under pressure.



7. Decision-Making





Key Point: Once the ball is received, strikers must decide whether to cross, pass, dribble, or cut inside based on the defensive setup and teammates’ positioning.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to scan for options before receiving the ball and assess defensive weaknesses (e.g., a slow recovery run).



Practice Scenario: Use small-sided games where strikers receive the ball wide or behind the defence, with multiple options for their next action.



8. Communication





Key Point: Strikers should use clear verbal and non-verbal cues to signal their intentions to teammates.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to call for the ball and point to where they want the pass delivered.



Practice Scenario: Run combination play drills where strikers must communicate their run or receiving area before the ball is played.



9. Exploiting Gaps in the Defensive Line





Key Point: Strikers must identify and attack spaces between defenders when running in behind.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to start their run from the blind side of a defender to increase the element of surprise.



Practice Scenario: Set up 2v2 scenarios where the striker runs off a defender's shoulder, focusing on exploiting gaps for through balls.



10. Transitioning After Receiving the Ball





Key Point: Once the ball is received, the striker should quickly transition into an attacking phase, either by delivering a cross, cutting inside, or setting up a shot.



Coaching Tip: Encourage decisive actions after receiving the ball to maintain the momentum of the attack.



Practice Scenario: Use drills where the striker receives the ball wide, makes a quick decision, and delivers a cross or takes a shot.





This individual exercises lets forward players drive in from a wide area to finish and then pull wide to run in behind to receive and cross.



11. Physical Fitness and Speed





Key Point: Pulling wide and running in behind require bursts of acceleration and the stamina to repeat these movements throughout the match.



Coaching Tip: Incorporate fitness drills that mimic match scenarios, focusing on sprinting and recovery.



Practice Scenario: Run sprint intervals combined with finishing drills to simulate match intensity.





Mbappe is the king of using his superior speed to sprint in behind a defence from a wide position when his team win the ball back.  His first touch and use of his body are key to quickly getting the ball under control so he can attack the goal before being crowded out.



12. Creativity in Wide and Behind Runs





Key Point: Strikers should vary their movements to keep defenders guessing, using diagonal runs, delayed runs, or sudden changes in direction.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to mix direct runs with feints or double movements to unbalance the defence.



Practice Scenario: Use shadow play drills where strikers practice different types of runs, alternating between pulling wide and attacking gaps behind the defence.



Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Pulling Wide and Running In Behind (Players)





Technical Drill: Receiving







Setup: Setup the exercise as show.  Replace the mini goal and mannequins with cones if required.



Execution:





A plays to B.



B receives, protect and dribbles through the gate .



Just beyond the gate, they execute a turn.



B then explode back to the mannequin/cone/pole .



B beats this with a scissor or small touch-big touch face-to-face move on the outside or inside.



B then delivers the pass/cross into the mini goal with an inside slide pass or chipped pass.



Players should not cross the dotted line at any point.



Coaching Points: Scan, protect, and unbalance the defender if you are going to turn.





Technical Drill: Receiving Under Pressure







Setup: Setup the exercise as show.  Replace the mini goal and mannequins with cones if required.



Execution:





A plays to B.



Initially, O (opposition) only defends on B’s touch.  After a few repetitions of the exercise, this restriction is removed.



B receives with the outside of the foot to protect.  Encourage B to use the space in front of them.



At the correct moment, B executes a turn away from O.



B then deliver the pass/cross into the mini goal with an inside slide pass or chipped pass. 



Progression 1: After the turn, O2 becomes active to give a face-to-face defensive threat (1v2).



Progression 2:  Let B/D combine with A/C to offer a passing threat for the attackers (2v2).





Technical Drill: Pulling Wide and Receiving







Setup: Setup the exercise as show.  Replace the mini goal and pole with cones if required.



Execution:





The striker starts wide and either starts to dribble or receives a pass from the coach as required.  Once the striker has dribbled through the cone circuit, they finish.



Immediately after the shot, the striker runs around the pole (moving centrally to wide) and receives a pass in the air.  Conrols the ball, and crosses in to the mini goal.



Progression: Add a passive defender to increase the challenge and simulate pressure.





Finishing Drill: Wide Finishing







Setup: Setup the exercise as show.  The cones should represent the route the striker should travel.



Execution:





The striker starts wide and plays a 1-2 with the coach/parent and finishes.



If you have an extra helper, you can incorporate a second finish which requires an aggressive change of pace by the striker.



Progression: Add a passive defender to increase the challenge and simulate pressure.





Finishing Drill: Wide to In Behind







Setup: Replace the mannequins with cones if easier and use cones or spare balls as targets if you do not have mini goals.



Execution:





The striker starts at one pace to come into the ball and then changes their pace to run behind.



Body Shape and First Touch are key.  Do not take too many steps after your first touch or a defender can recover and block (in a game).



Don't switch off after the shot, immediately react to the second ball to react and finish.



Coaching Points: Timing of movement, staying onside, body shape, and first touch.



Team Session Plans to Help Teach Pulling Wide and Running In Behind (Coaches)





Positional Drill: Wide and Behind Movement







Setup: 7 aside game with 3 zones.  Only a Striker and Defender are allowed in the end zones.



Execution:





The Striker (S) can score in the big goals against the goalkeeper.  



The Defender (D) can score in the mini goals.



As soon as the ball goes into an end zone, the coach fires another ball into the middle to keep things flowing (and stop the players from being bored).   



Coaching Points: Timing of runs, communication, and exploiting space in the channels.





Game Scenario: Breaking Down a Defence







Setup: Use two-thirds of the pitch. Set up an 7v7+1 game with full-size goals and a 2-man defense for each team.



Execution:





Encourage strikers to pull wide and run in behind when the team has possession.



Focus on midfielders and wingers supporting these movements with through balls or overlapping runs.



Coaching Points: Recognize when to hold wide or make a diagonal run, effective use of wingers, and communication between the striker and midfielders.





Game Simulation: Pressing and Counter Pressing Game







Setup: The game setup is 2 separate teams, playing 2 different formations, in the highlighted zone



Execution:





The game always starts from a goalkeeper.  The team in possession must make 5 passes in the zone before they can exit the zone and try to score in the goal they are attacking. Once they attack the goal, the attacker has 7 seconds to score



Defenders are not allowed to follow a pass that exits the zone.



When an attacker (e.g. Blue Team) goes through on goal and is finished their attempt, a new ball is quickly played to the goalkeeper (e.g. Red Team) so the team has an overload. Attacker has to recover to the zone.



The defenders for the team in possession can drop out of the zone to receive passes (e.g. can go back to receive from the GK and/or drop to switch play), but only passes in the zone count towards the target



Progression 1: One team has to make 5 passes, and the other can attack the goal as soon as they win it (no minimum passes requirement)

Progression 2: One team only defends with 7 players, the front 3 don’t defend. As soon as the ball is won, the front 3 become involved again





Finishing Drill: Lose Your Width



All exercises should be done the same phase, then players follow their initial pass (Black Line) to rotate positions





Setup: All exercises should be done the same phase, then players follow their initial pass (Black Line) to rotate positions



Execution:





Black Line



The exercise starts with player (O), who passes to (1), who plays into (2)



This is the cue for movement as (2) is facing forward. (4) is in the shadow of the defender, they then move across the defender to set (3)



This is the cue for a diagonal run from wide. (3) then plays (5), who has run in behind the defender to finish



Red Line



After the shot from (5), they should make an aggressive run across the cone to finish from a pass from (6)



Blue Line



Same setup as first exercise (black line) but when the ball is played to (2), (3) makes a deep run diagonally to receive a reverse pass from (2) and finish



Coaching Points: If you receive on the touchline in the final third, good teams will shift across and shut you down, forcing you back. Lose your width instead and play on the outside of their shape
