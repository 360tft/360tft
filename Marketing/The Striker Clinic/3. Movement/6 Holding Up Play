Section Introduction

Holding up play is a fundamental skill for strikers, allowing them to retain possession under pressure and link the team’s attack effectively. By using their body to shield the ball and waiting for teammates to join the play, strikers can slow the game down when needed, relieve defensive pressure, and create opportunities for runners from midfield or wide areas. 

This ability is particularly crucial when playing against well-organized defences or during counterattacks, making it an essential aspect of a striker’s role in modern football.

If a defender is tight, you can use your body to manipulate them in order to gain an advantage. 

This can be done by either; 

1. Using your body and skill to roll your defender and/or get turned.

2. Pinning your defender, looking to hold the ball up and link in with other team-mates.



You can see an example of this in the video.  Note how the striker uses her body to hold off the defender and link with her teammates.

Holding Up Play

Why Hold-Up Play is Crucial for a Striker

Hold-up play is one of the most essential skills for a striker, allowing them to bring others into the game, relieve pressure on their team, and create opportunities from difficult situations. Here’s why it’s so important and how to execute it effectively:



1. Controlling the Game Under Pressure

When defenders are tight, a striker’s ability to use their body effectively becomes critical. Hold-up play allows you to maintain possession under pressure, giving your teammates time to:





Transition into attacking positions.



Reorganize after a defensive phase.



Exploit gaps created in the opposition’s defensive shape.

Key Tip: Keep a strong, low stance with your arms out for balance and to shield the ball from the defender.



2. Using Your Body to Gain an Advantage





Rolling Your Defender:
If a defender is overly aggressive or tight, you can use their momentum against them. A quick touch or a turn can leave them behind, creating space for a shot or pass.



Pinning Your Defender:
By positioning yourself between the ball and the defender, you can "pin" them, making it difficult for them to win the ball. This allows you to hold possession and wait for support from teammates.



3. Linking Up with Teammates

Effective hold-up play isn’t just about keeping the ball; it’s about connecting with your team:





Layoffs and Flicks: Use one-touch passes to set up oncoming midfielders or wingers for shots or crosses.



Switching Play: Hold the ball long enough to allow your team to shift the play to a less congested area.



Combination Play: Work with nearby teammates to create quick passing moves that break defensive lines.

Professional Example: Players like Harry Kane excel at dropping deep, holding up the ball, and delivering precise passes to teammates making runs.





This exercise is a simple way for players to practice dropping deep to link play.  These exercises are unopposed so you can coach the fundementals of this concept.



4. Creating Space for Others

By engaging and occupying one or more defenders, you can create space for your teammates to:





Make runs into the box.



Take advantage of gaps left by defenders focused on you.



Gain time and space to take long shots or deliver crosses.





You can see in the image that the striker has dropped deep to retain possession and then link with his teammates, who are making crucial runs off the ball.



5. Relieving Defensive Pressure

Hold-up play is especially important in moments when your team is under pressure. By holding the ball in advanced positions, you allow your defence and midfield to move up the pitch, relieving pressure and establishing a more organized shape.



6. Key Skills for Effective Hold-Up Play





Strength and Balance: Keep your stance strong to shield the ball from defenders.



First Touch: Control the ball cleanly to maintain possession under pressure.



Awareness: Know where your teammates and defenders are to make quick decisions.



Decision-Making: Recognize when to hold the ball, pass, or turn and attack.



7. The Importance of Timing

Hold-up play is most effective when executed at the right time. Holding the ball too long can result in losing possession, while releasing it too early may waste opportunities. The key is to balance patience and quick execution.



How To Hold Up Play- The Key Points

Hold-up play is about more than just strength; it’s about intelligence, timing, and teamwork. By mastering this skill, you not only elevate your own game but also become the linchpin of your team’s attack, enabling others to thrive and creating a more cohesive and effective offensive unit.

1. Awareness and Scanning





Key Point: Strikers must scan their surroundings before receiving the ball to identify nearby defenders, supporting teammates, and spaces to exploit.



Coaching Tip: Develop a habit of checking over both shoulders to anticipate pressure and plan the next action.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where the striker must identify the position of cones or defenders behind them before receiving the ball.



2. Body Positioning





Key Point: The striker’s body position is crucial for shielding the ball from defenders and maintaining balance while under pressure.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to keep a low centre of gravity and position themselves side-on to the defender, using their arms and back for protection.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 shielding drills where the striker receives the ball with their back to goal and must hold off a defender.



3. Physicality and Strength





Key Point: Strikers need physical strength to hold their position and resist challenges from defenders.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to engage in strength training and practice holding the ball while under contact.



Practice Scenario: Use resistance drills where a defender applies pressure while the striker holds the ball for a set period.



4. Receiving the Ball





Key Point: The first touch is critical in controlling the ball under pressure and setting up the next action.



Coaching Tip: Focus on taking a purposeful first touch that keeps the ball close and away from the defender.



Practice Scenario: Use passing drills where the striker receives a hard, low pass and practices controlling it while under light defensive pressure.





In training, really encourage your players to strike the ball hard and low when playing to feet so your players can enhance their ability to control the ball in one or two touches.



5. Decision-Making





Key Point: Strikers must decide quickly whether to pass, turn, or continue holding the ball based on the defender’s position and their teammates’ movements.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to visualize their next move before receiving the ball, reducing hesitation.



Practice Scenario: Use small-sided games where the striker must hold the ball before releasing it to a teammate making a run.



6. Communication





Key Point: Strikers must communicate effectively with teammates to signal their intent and coordinate attacking movements.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to use verbal cues like “hold” or “run” and non-verbal signals like pointing or eye contact.



Practice Scenario: Run combination play drills where the striker communicates with midfielders and wingers to orchestrate attacking plays.



7. Linking Play





Key Point: Holding up play should create opportunities for teammates by allowing them time to join the attack or exploit spaces left by the defence.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to focus on accurate lay-offs and quick one-touch passes to maintain attacking momentum.



Practice Scenario: Use drills where midfielders and wingers make runs while the striker holds the ball and lays it off to their path.



8. Turning Under Pressure





Key Point: Strikers should know when to hold the ball longer or when to spin and turn the defender to create scoring opportunities.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to feel the defender’s pressure and spin away if they sense the defender leaning too heavily on one side.



Practice Scenario: Use 1v1 drills where the striker practices turning quickly after holding the ball.



9. Exploiting Space Created





Key Point: By holding the ball, the striker can draw defenders out of position, creating space for teammates to exploit.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to recognize when defenders are overcommitted and release the ball quickly to take advantage of the space created.



Practice Scenario: Use 3v2 drills where the striker holds up the ball to draw defenders before releasing it to a teammate running into space.





In this clip, it looks like the player highlighted has lots of space and time but at this level, he will be closed down quickly.  The two defenders highlighted here will be pulled out of position to close the ball so an awareness of this, and the ability to turn under pressure to release the ball is a key skill to learn.



10. Mental Composure





Key Point: Holding up play often involves intense physical and mental pressure, requiring composure and patience.



Coaching Tip: Encourage strikers to stay calm, even when surrounded by defenders, and focus on executing their actions cleanly.



Practice Scenario: Use time-based drills where the striker holds the ball for a set duration under increasing defensive pressure.



11. Timing of the Hold-Up





Key Point: The striker must understand when to hold the ball versus when to release it quickly to keep the attack fluid.



Coaching Tip: Teach strikers to hold the ball long enough to allow teammates to join but not so long that they lose momentum.



Practice Scenario: Use situational drills where the striker practices holding the ball until supporting players arrive.



12. Confidence in Contact





Key Point: Holding up play often involves physical battles, and strikers need the confidence to thrive in these situations.



Coaching Tip: Build confidence through physical training and by simulating match conditions in practice.



Practice Scenario: Use 2v2 drills where the striker receives the ball and must maintain possession while under pressure from both defenders.





The play in this clip is quite congested and the striker who is going to receive the ball must be confident to receive and aware enough to play the correct pass once he does so.   Therefore, he needs to understand what he is going to do with the ball before he even receives it.



Individual Session Plans to Help Learn Hold Up Play (Players)





Technical Drill: Receiving







Setup: Setup the exercise as show.  Replace the mini goal and mannequins with cones if required.



Execution:





A plays to B.



B receives, protect and dribbles through the gate.



Just beyond the gate, they execute a turn.



B then explode back to the mannequin/cone/pole .



B beats this with a scissor or small touch-big touch face-to-face move on the outside or inside.



B then delivers the pass/cross into the mini goal with an inside slide pass or chipped pass. 



Players should not cross the dotted line at any point.



Coaching Points: Scan, Protect, and Unbalance the defender if you are going to turn.





Technical Drill: Receiving Under Pressure







Setup: Setup the exercise as show.  Replace the mini goal and mannequins with cones if required.



Execution:





A plays to B



Initially, O (opposition) only defends on B’s touch.  After a few repetitions of the exercise, this restriction is removed.



B receives with the outside of the foot to protect.  Encourage B to use the space in front of them.

At the correct moment, B executes a turn away from O.

B then deliver the pass/cross into the mini goal with an inside slide pass or chipped pass. 

Progression 1:   After the turn, O2 becomes active to give a face-to-face defensive threat (1v2).

Progression 2:   Let B/D combine with A/C to offer a passing threat for the attackers (2v2).



Progression: After the turn, O2 becomes active to give a face-to-face defensive threat (1v2).

Progression 2: Let B/D combine with A/C to offer a passing threat for the attackers (2v2)





Shielding Drill: Basic Hold-Up Play







Setup: Use a 10x10-meter grid. The striker starts with their back to a mannequin or partner (acting as a defender) who applies light pressure.



Execution:





The striker receives a pass from a coach or feeder and shields the ball from the defender for 5 seconds.



Once secured, the striker plays a return pass to the feeder.



Progression:





Coach applies light pressure from the front so the players first touch needs to be tight.





Decision-Making Drill: Hold-Up and Link







Setup: Use the final third . Coach plays player who has mannequin or cone to their back.  Drill shows a second finish if you have another player, but this is not required if not.



Execution:





The striker receives the ball under pressure, shields it, and decides between:





Laying it back to the coach (pr off to a nearby teammate).



Turning to create space for a shot.



Holding the ball longer to allow time for more support.



Coaching Points: Focus on body positioning, quick decisions, and effective communication.





Finishing Drill: Hold-Up to Goal







Setup: Use the final third with a goal and goalkeeper.



Execution:





The striker receives the ball with their back to goal, shields it from a defender, and executes one of the following:





A quick turn and shot.



A pass back to the coach for a one-two before finishing.



Progression: Add a defender to increase difficulty.

Positional Drill: Hold-Up and Support







 Setup: 3 different games in a small setup across the middle of the pitch.





Game 1:  Blacks score in the goals after x passes.  Blues win and dribble through a gate.



Game 2:  Black plays to black, who has back to defender.  Black receives, turns and drives through gate.  If blue wins, they drive through gates.



Game 3:  Wide goal game.



Coaching Points: Emphasize timing, communication, and decision-making.





Small-Sided Game: Hold-Up Focus







 Setup: 7v7+1 game on a reduced field with two goals.  Goals can be scored in any manner, and players are free to move into different zones as required.



Execution:





Focus on the striker holding the ball and linking with midfielders and wingers.



Award bonus points for successful hold-up plays leading to goals.



Coaching Points: Emphasize timing, communication, and decision-making.





Game Scenario: Find the Strikers Feet







 Setup: Play 5v5+4 in a zone.



Execution:





Players on inside can play 5 passes for a goal.



Defenders apply pressure, forcing quick decisions.



Progression:  5 passes and then pass to player behind goal and back in for a goal.





Finishing Exercise: 1v1 Finishing







Setup: Use the penalty box and two goals as per the diagram.   The game in the box can be a 1v1 or 2v2, with the remaining players places around the edge of the box.



Execution:





One player/team attacks and the other defends. If the game is 2v2 then only one player can receive the ball on a team.



The attacking player/team get 5 shots/balls before their turn is over.



After this point, another two players/teams enter the field to replace the defending and attacking teams, who take their place.



Double movements are the key to this game. Fake to get a ball from one player and explode to another to receieve/finish.



Progression: Reduce the strikers to 2 touch, meaning their movement is key.





Finishing Exercise: 1v1 Game







Setup: Split the pitch into 4 boxes (or more/less to suit the numbers) and your players into 3 teams.  Each box should be a 1v1 and a bounce player in the corner - one player from each team in eahc box.  Players are not allowed out of their box.   



Execution:





Game starts from one corner, with one team starting as the attacking team.   The attacking team needs to make 5 passes before they can score.



If there is a turnover of possession then the other team has a chance to make 5 passes and score.  If the ball goes out of play, the game restarts from a different corner player.



When a team successfully scores, the team who concedes becomes the corner team.



Progression: Remove the squares and play a bigger game.
