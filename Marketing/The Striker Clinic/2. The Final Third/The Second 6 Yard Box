What is the Second Six-Yard Box?

The second six-yard box refers to the area six to twelve yards out from the goal. It's a critical space for creating high-percentage scoring opportunities. During the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, six teams scored all of their open-play goals from this zone. Germany led the way with four goals, while champions Spain generated 29% of their shots from this area, converting six of their 13 open-play goals (54%).

This zone’s importance is further emphasized by how frequently the ball received here results in a shot. In the 2022/23 Premier League season, 71% of balls received in the second six-yard box led to a shot on goal. Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes was particularly prolific, delivering 14 passes into this zone, with 82% leading to a shot and 79% resulting in a goal. Some players achieved even greater precision—Jared Bowen, Gabriel Martinelli, and Philip Billing each delivered seven passes into the zone, creating a scoring opportunity every single time.

Case Study: Sam Kerr and Erling Haaland

Chelsea's Sam Kerr, one of the WSL's most clinical forwards, exemplifies how effective this zone can be. Across 70+ WSL appearances, Kerr has scored over 50 open-play goals, with 40% coming from the second six-yard box. Last season alone, she received the ball in this zone 25 times, getting a shot off 96% of the time and scoring three goals. Her career average? One goal for every four shots in this area.



In the Premier League, Erling Haaland dominated the second six-yard box in the 2022/23 season, receiving the ball 38 times and getting a shot away 92% of the time. His efficiency was unmatched, scoring a goal every 2.9 shots. Last season, Tottenham’s Son Heung-Min took the mantle, scoring five goals from just eight shots in the second six-yard box—a conversion rate of 62% or one goal for every 1.6 shots.

Youth Development: The Second Six-Yard Box in Academies

The importance of the second six-yard box isn’t just seen at the professional level—it’s evident in youth football too. In a study of over 380 goals scored in boys’ professional academies, we found the following trends for 11v11 games:





U16s: 51% of goals were scored from the second six-yard box.



U14s: The figure dropped slightly to 31%.

In smaller-sided games, adjusted for relative pitch areas (RPA), similar trends emerged:





9v9 (U12s): 34% of goals came from this zone.



7v7 (U9s): 33% of goals were scored here.

While these statistics are derived from a specific case study, they highlight the importance of understanding goal-scoring patterns for different ages and stages of development. We encourage you to analyze your own players and teams—patterns may vary widely based on the context.

What Makes the Second Six-Yard Box So Effective?

The second six-yard box is a prime scoring zone because it optimizes angles and proximity to the goal, increasing the likelihood of a successful finish. Players like Kerr and Haaland consistently demonstrate the ability to position themselves perfectly in this space, making intelligent movements to capitalize on crosses and through balls.

Takeaway

The second six-yard box is a game-changing area for creating and converting goal-scoring opportunities, whether you’re coaching pros, academy players, or youth teams. Understanding its importance and training your players to exploit this space can dramatically improve results. So, how will you incorporate this insight into your coaching?

The Impact On Your Training Sessions

To effectively incorporate the second six-yard box into training, coaches should design drills, scenarios, and match-relevant activities that encourage players to recognize, occupy, and exploit this critical area.
