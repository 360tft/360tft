Different Finishing Zones for Strikers

Strikers must understand the different zones in and around the penalty area to maximise their goal-scoring potential. Each zone requires a unique approach to finishing, influenced by the angle, distance from goal, and type of delivery. The diagram highlights five distinct zones: Golden Zone, Assist Zones, Outside the Box, and Wide Areas (Left and Right). 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these zones, their characteristics, and how strikers can maximise their effectiveness in each.  Understanding the final third, will allow you to move on to the different aspects of playing in the final third.



1. Golden Zone (One-Touch Finishing)

The Golden Zone is the area directly in front of the goal within the penalty box, often referred to as the "prime scoring area." Shots from this zone are high-percentage chances due to the proximity to goal and reduced angles for the goalkeeper.





Characteristics:





Ideal for one-touch finishes.



High-pressure area with defenders closing in quickly.



Often the target for cutbacks, low-driven crosses, and rebounds.



Techniques for Success:





One-Touch Finishes: Use instep or laces for accuracy and power.



Anticipation: React quickly to crosses or loose balls in the box.



Composure: Stay calm under pressure to ensure clean contact with the ball.



Training Focus:





Practise reacting to rebounds and first-time finishes from close range.



Simulate high-pressure scenarios with defenders applying light pressure.



2. Assist Zones (Two-Touch Finishing)

The Assist Zones are located to the left and right of the Golden Zone, slightly wider but still inside the penalty box. These areas are key for setting up chances or finishing from angled positions.





Characteristics:





Ideal for strikers receiving cutbacks or low crosses.



Often involves a second touch to control before finishing.



Angled shots increase the difficulty of beating the goalkeeper.



Techniques for Success:





Two-Touch Control and Finish: Use the first touch to set up the ball and the second to strike.



Angle Awareness: Aim for the far post to maximise scoring chances.



Movement: Time runs to attack the space between defenders.



Training Focus:





Drills focusing on receiving cutbacks and finishing with two touches.



Positioning exercises to optimise movement into the assist zones.



3. Outside the Box (Two-Touch or Multi-Touch Play)

The Outside the Box area is primarily for long-range shots or setting up teammates. Strikers in this zone need to create space for themselves or others to generate shooting opportunities.





Characteristics:





Low-percentage shooting area, but effective for long-range efforts.



Often involves defenders pressing to block shots.



Key for linking up play before advancing into the Golden Zone.



Techniques for Success:





Controlled Shots: Focus on accuracy over power for long-range finishes.



Dribbling: Use skill moves to create space for a shot.



Vision: Look for through-ball opportunities to teammates making runs.



Training Focus:





Long-range shooting drills to improve accuracy and power.



Combination play exercises to transition into the penalty box.



4. Wide Areas (Outside R and Outside L)

The Wide Areas are on the left and right flanks, outside the penalty box. While strikers rarely score from these zones, they play a crucial role in creating chances for teammates.





Characteristics:





Key areas for delivering crosses or combining with wingers.



Often used to draw defenders wide and create space centrally.



Less direct threat to goal but highly influential in chance creation.



Techniques for Success:





Crossing: Deliver accurate balls into the Golden Zone or Assist Zones.



Combination Play: Link up with wingers and full-backs to create overloads.



Movement: Drift wide to stretch the defence and open central spaces.



Training Focus:





Crossing and finishing drills to improve delivery from wide areas.



Positional drills to practise combining with teammates on the flanks.

Understanding and mastering the finishing zones is crucial for strikers aiming to optimise their goal-scoring potential. Each zone presents unique opportunities and challenges, requiring specific techniques and movements. By refining their skills in the Golden Zone, Assist Zones, and wide areas, strikers can become versatile and effective finishers, capable of adapting to any situation in the final third.
