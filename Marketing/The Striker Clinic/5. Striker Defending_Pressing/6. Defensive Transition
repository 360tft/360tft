Defensive transition is the critical phase when a team shifts from attack to defence immediately after losing possession. For strikers, this moment often dictates whether the opposition can launch a successful counterattack or is forced to play backwards or wide.

The first responsibility of a striker in a defensive transition is to apply immediate pressure to the player who wins the ball. Known as "counter-pressing," this tactic aims to win back possession quickly or disrupt the opponent's ability to start a counterattack. Effective counter-pressing requires anticipation, quick reactions, and positioning.

Indeed, the terminology in the video above is:





Position:  Getting players into a positionally superior structure to react to any loss of possession



Movement:  Reacting to the loss of possession



Dominate:   The press and the pressure



Terminate:  Winning the ball back

Strikers should focus on staying compact with their team during transitions. Even if they can't win the ball back directly, they can help block passing lanes and delay the opposition's progression. This buys time for their midfielders and defenders to recover their shape.





These players are in and around the ball now, putting the player in possession under real pressure.

Communication is vital during defensive transitions. Strikers must coordinate their pressing efforts with nearby players to ensure the team remains organized. A disjointed press can leave gaps for the opposition to exploit.

Positioning during defensive transitions also matters. Strikers should avoid being caught too high up the pitch, as this can create space for the opponent to play through. Instead, they should adjust their position to stay connected with their teammates.

Mental sharpness is key to excelling in defensive transitions. Strikers must react instantly to the loss of possession, shifting their mindset from attacking to defending without hesitation.
