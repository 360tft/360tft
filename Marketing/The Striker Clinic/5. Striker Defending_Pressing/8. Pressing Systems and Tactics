Pressing systems dictate how a team organizes its pressing efforts. Strikers play a central role in executing these systems, as they often initiate the press and set the tone for the rest of the team.





High Press: In this system, strikers aggressively press defenders and goalkeepers to win the ball back high up the pitch. The objective is to disrupt the oppositionâ€™s build-up play and create immediate scoring opportunities.





An example of a team setup to press high and aggressively, with each player understanding their role.



Midfield Press: Strikers drop slightly deeper, focusing on cutting off passes into midfield. This approach is useful against teams that bypass the press with long balls.



Low Block with Pressing Triggers: Strikers maintain compact positioning with their team, only pressing aggressively when the ball enters specific areas or when pressing triggers are activated (e.g., a backward pass).

Strikers need to understand their specific roles in each system. For example, in a high press, the striker might target the centre-backs, while in a midfield press, their role might be to shadow a defensive midfielder.

Effective pressing systems rely on coordination. Strikers must communicate with wingers and midfielders to ensure the press is synchronized and compact. Miscommunication can lead to gaps that the opposition can exploit.







Team Training Session: Pressing System Walkthrough







Setup:
Set up a full pitch with a defensive team practicing high, midfield, and low-block pressing.  7v7-11v11+1



Execution:





The attacking team can only be in the attacking half.



If the defending team wins the ball, the attacking team can only counter press in the attacking half.  



If the defending team get over the halfway line, they cannot be followed but only have 7 seconds to score.



Strikers practice their roles in each pressing system.



Key Focus:
Team coordination, role clarity, and situational pressing.
