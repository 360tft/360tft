Transitioning from defence to attack is where strikers can make the biggest impact, turning defensive efforts into goal-scoring opportunities. This phase requires sharp awareness, quick decision-making, and explosive movement.





Positioning: After winning the ball back, strikers should position themselves to exploit gaps in the opponent’s defence. This often involves staying central or drifting into space where they can receive the ball.



Awareness: Strikers must scan the field to identify teammates making forward runs or spaces to exploit. This allows them to make quick, decisive passes or runs.



First Touch: A good first touch is critical during transitions. It can set up a shot, create space, or play in a teammate.



Communication: Strikers need to communicate with midfielders and wingers to ensure the attack is coordinated. This might involve signalling for a through ball or directing teammates to exploit specific spaces.

Transitioning effectively requires a balance between composure and urgency. Strikers must act quickly to capitalize on the opponent’s disorganization but remain composed to ensure quality in their decisions and execution.



Team Training Session: Pressing and Counter Pressing Game







Setup: The game setup is 2 separate teams, playing 2 different formations, in the highlighted zone



Execution:





The game always starts from a goalkeeper.  The team in possession must make 5 passes in the zone before they can exit the zone and try to score in the goal they are attacking. Once they attack the goal, the attacker has 7 seconds to score.



Defenders are not allowed to follow a pass that exits the zone.



When an attacker (e.g. Blue Team) goes through on goal and is finished their attempt, a new ball is quickly played to the goalkeeper (e.g. Red Team) so the team has an overload. Attacker has to recover to the zone.



The defenders for the team in possession can drop out of the zone to receive passes (e.g. can go back to receive from the GK and/or drop to switch play), but only passes in the zone count towards the target.



Progression 1: One team has to make 5 passes, and the other can attack the goal as soon as they win it (no minimum passes requirement).

Progression 2: One team only defends with 7 players, the front 3 don’t defend. As soon as the ball is won, the front 3 become involved again.
