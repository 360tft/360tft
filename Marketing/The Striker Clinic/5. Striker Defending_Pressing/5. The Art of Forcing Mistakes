Pressing isn’t just about winning the ball—it’s about forcing the opponent to make mistakes that disrupt their rhythm and create opportunities for your team. Strikers play a crucial role in this by using their positioning, movement, and body language to apply pressure intelligently.

One way strikers force mistakes is by closing down defenders while angling their runs to block easy passing options. For example, a striker might approach a centre-back while positioning themselves to cut off a pass to the defensive midfielder. This forces the defender to play wide or attempt a riskier pass, increasing the likelihood of an error.

Another tactic is to force the ball into less favourable areas. By pressing in a way that limits forward options, strikers can guide the opponent into wide spaces where they’re more likely to be isolated and lose possession.

Body positioning is critical in forcing mistakes. Strikers should stay low, use quick, controlled steps, and avoid overcommitting. This keeps the defender under constant stress while maintaining the striker’s ability to react to changes in play.

Strikers must also learn to use their body as a physical barrier. Shielding passing lanes or getting close enough to disrupt an opponent’s balance can lead to turnovers without the need for a direct tackle.

Elite pressing strikers like Gabriel Jesus and Timo Werner excel at forcing mistakes by staying relentless and calculated in their approach. Their pressing not only disrupts the opponent’s flow but also creates goal-scoring opportunities through turnovers.





The press here will force the ball wide and allow Liverpool to win the ball back.  The press itself doesn't win the ball, but forces the ball wide and forces a mistake.





Team Training Session: Controlled Mistake Creation







Setup: Split the pitch into 4 boxes (or more/less to suit the numbers) and your players into 3 teams.  Each box should be a 1v1 and a bounce player in the corner - one player from each team in each box.  Players are not allowed out of their box.   



Execution:





Game starts from one corner, with one team starting as the attacking team.   The attacking team needs to make 5 passes before they can score.



If there is a turnover of possession then the other team has a chance to make 5 passes and score.  If the ball goes out of play, the game restarts from a different corner player.



When a team successfully scores, the team who concedes becomes the corner team.



Progression: Remove the squares and play a bigger game.



Key Focus:
Forcing predictable play and exploiting errors.
