Defending and pressing are as much mental as they are physical. Strikers must maintain focus, discipline, and resilience to contribute effectively in these phases.





Focus: Strikers must remain alert to pressing triggers and their role within the team’s defensive structure. Losing concentration can lead to gaps that opponents can exploit.





Discipline: Overcommitting in a press can leave the team exposed. Strikers must balance aggression with tactical awareness, knowing when to press and when to hold their position.



Resilience: Pressing is demanding and often doesn’t result in immediate success. Strikers need the mental fortitude to keep pressing consistently throughout the game, even when results aren’t immediate.



Team Mentality: Pressing requires coordination and trust among teammates. Strikers must communicate effectively and support their teammates to ensure the press functions as a unit.

Developing these mental traits involves practice, experience, and reflection. Strikers who master the psychological aspects of defending and pressing become invaluable assets to their teams.



Team Training Session: High Press Repitition







Setup:
The game consists of 2 teams that always go in pairs to goal. You need two goalkeepers and 2 goals, and plenty of footballs. Teams must pass the ball at least once.



Execution:





The game starts with the first two Blue players (one with the ball and one without) going towards the Red goalkeeper. As soon as they have had their shot on goal, the first two Red players can then go towards the Blue goalkeeper. However, as soon as Blue has shot they need to turn and defend against Red, putting them under pressure.



If Red score, the next pair of Blue go and the Red defend.



The game continues like this so a pair attack and then defend. After a pair has attacked and defended, they grab a ball and re-join their queue, swapping over, ready for their next turn.



If the defending team wins the ball, including the goalkeeper, they must attempt to score against the other team. The team who just lost the ball can attempt to steal it back and score.



The attack/defend sequence only ends when the ball goes out of play. This is the trigger for the next team to go.



Teams receive a point each time they score.



The game continues for a set time limit, and a winner is declared



Key Focus:
Mentality to defend and work hard, teamwork, anticipation, and creating scoring opportunities from turnovers.
