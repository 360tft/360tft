Tracking back involves a striker retreating to help their team defend deeper areas of the pitch. While it’s not a striker’s primary responsibility, it’s a crucial aspect of modern football, where all players contribute to the defensive phase.

Strikers track back when their team is under sustained pressure or outnumbered in midfield. By retreating, they can help compress space, block passing lanes, and provide additional defensive coverage.

Effective tracking back requires spatial awareness. Strikers must identify where they’re needed most — whether it’s closing down a midfielder, blocking a passing lane, or marking a defender who has pushed forward.

Stamina is another critical factor. Strikers who track back must have the physical capacity to recover quickly and still be effective in attack. This balance can be managed through conditioning drills emphasising high-intensity bursts and recovery.

Tracking back also involves decision-making. Strikers need to know when it’s beneficial to retreat versus staying forward to maintain a counterattacking threat. Teams often assign specific roles to strikers in these situations, such as shadowing a defensive midfielder or occupying a central zone.
