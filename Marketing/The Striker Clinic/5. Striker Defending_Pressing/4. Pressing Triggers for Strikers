Pressing triggers are the moments in a game that signal when a striker should initiate pressure on an opponent. These triggers are critical to an effective pressing system, ensuring that pressing efforts are coordinated and impactful.

One common pressing trigger is a backward pass. When an opponent passes back to their goalkeeper or a defender, it often signals a moment of vulnerability. Strikers can use this opportunity to close down the receiver, forcing a rushed clearance or mistake.



You can see this happen in the above video, the striker scans and sees he will have support in the press so continues his run and forces the goalkeeper into a rushed clearance.

Another pressing trigger is a poor first touch. If an opponent struggles to control the ball, it creates a window for the striker to pounce and regain possession. Recognizing this trigger requires sharp observation and quick reactions.

A lateral pass between defenders is another pressing trigger, especially if the receiving player is under pressure from a teammate. Strikers can capitalize on this by cutting off passing options and forcing the opponent to play long or into congested areas.

Body positioning of the opponent can also serve as a pressing trigger. If a defender receives the ball with their back to the field or facing the sideline, they have limited options. Strikers can use this opportunity to press aggressively, knowing the opponent is less likely to play forward.

Pressing triggers are most effective when they’re coordinated with the team’s overall defensive structure. If a striker presses without support, it can leave gaps and make the press easy to bypass. Communication with teammates is essential to ensure pressing efforts are synchronized.





You can see that the Liverpool player here scans and sees he has support behind so can go press as a unit (with his teammates).

The ability to recognize pressing triggers is a skill that can be developed through match analysis and training. Watching game footage to identify moments where pressing led to turnovers can help strikers understand when and how to press effectively.





Individual Training Session: Trigger Recognition







Setup:
Use a 30x30-meter grid with one striker and a coach.



Execution:





The striker receives passes to the coach, who performs various actions (e.g., a heavy touch, backward pass).



The striker only reacts based on the action, pressing when a trigger is activated.



Key Focus:
Reacting quickly to pressing cues, staying composed, and applying controlled pressure.





Team Training Session: Triggered Pressing Simulation









Setup:
4v2 Rondo



Execution:





Defenders (blue) hold a bib/pinnie and as soon as one of the defenders win the ball or forces it out of play, they drop the bib.



The player who lost the ball will become the defender.



The game never stops when this happens. If the ball has gone out of play, the coach will fire a new ball in straight away.



If a defender wins the ball and drops their bib, can the second defender take advantage and win the ball from them? This will make the game more transitional.



Make sure that the tempo is high and the game never stops. This allows attackers to control the tempo with the ball



The defending team applies pressure when a trigger occurs.



Key Focus:
Communication, timing of the press, and pressing as a coordinated unit.
