Defensive positioning is the foundation of effective pressing for strikers. While it might seem counterintuitive for an attacking player to prioritize positioning when out of possession, it’s this awareness that often sets elite strikers apart.

The first rule of defensive positioning is staying goal-side of the ball. This means positioning yourself between the ball and your own goal, making it harder for the opposition to progress play. For strikers, this often involves blocking passing lanes to the central midfield, forcing opponents to play wide or backwards.



You can see this in the video above.  Even though Lewandowski is the main striker for Barcelona, he has show positional awareness to get behind the ball and then win it back for his team.

A striker’s defensive positioning should also complement the team’s shape. For example, in a 4-3-3 system, the striker might position themselves to block passes to the opposing defensive midfielder while wingers close down the fullbacks. This coordination ensures the press is compact and difficult to bypass.

Awareness is equally important as positioning. Strikers must constantly scan the field, identifying potential passing options for the opponent. This allows them to anticipate moves and react quickly, whether by intercepting a pass or adjusting their position to maintain pressure.





Effective defensive positioning also involves body orientation. Strikers should position their body to guide opponents into less favourable areas, such as the sidelines. This limits the opponent’s options and increases the chances of forcing a turnover.

Maintaining defensive positioning requires discipline. Strikers must resist the temptation to overcommit or chase the ball aimlessly, which can open gaps for the opponent to exploit. Instead, they should focus on maintaining their shape and waiting for the right moment to press.

Elite strikers like Karim Benzema and Robert Lewandowski excel at defensive positioning, often starting their team's press by cutting off key passing options. This awareness not only disrupts the opposition but also positions the striker to capitalize on mistakes.





Team Training Session: Pressing Rondo







Setup:
Use a rondo square. One team (the 5) keeps possession, while the 2 defenders try to win it back.



Execution:





Black team are on 2 touch.



If the Blues win the ball within 5 passes, both players get out of the middle.  More than 5 passes and the player who wins it gets out, and the other stays in until they win it.



Key Focus:
Maintaining compactness, pressing angles, and cutting off central options.
