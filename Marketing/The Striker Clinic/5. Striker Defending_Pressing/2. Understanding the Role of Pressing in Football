Pressing is an integral part of modern football, with teams at every level using it to dictate the flow of the game. For strikers, pressing isn’t just about chasing the ball aimlessly—it’s a calculated effort to disrupt the opposition's rhythm and force them into mistakes. Pressing begins with the striker, who often acts as the first line of defense.

A well-executed press sets the tone for the entire team. It can disrupt the opponent's build-up play, force turnovers in dangerous areas, and limit their ability to play out from the back. Teams like Liverpool and Manchester City are prime examples of how high-pressing systems can dominate games and suffocate opponents.

For strikers, pressing involves more than just energy and effort. It requires tactical intelligence to recognize pressing triggers, such as a defender receiving a pass under pressure or a poorly controlled ball. By identifying these moments, strikers can press effectively and efficiently, conserving energy while maximizing impact.

One of the primary goals of pressing is to cut off passing lanes and isolate the ball carrier. A striker’s positioning is crucial here, as they must angle their runs to force the opponent into predictable decisions, such as passing wide or back to the goalkeeper.





You can see the midfielder is pressing the player on the ball, with the striker covering the pass back to the goalkeeper.

Strikers must also understand how their pressing fits into the team's overall strategy. In a high-press system, their primary objective might be to pressure center-backs or fullbacks. In a midfield press, the focus shifts to blocking passing options into the midfield. Being aware of these nuances helps strikers press intelligently rather than expending energy ineffectively.

The role of pressing isn’t just defensive—it can also lead directly to goal-scoring opportunities. A well-timed press can result in winning the ball high up the pitch, creating a chance before the opponent has time to reorganize defensively.

Ultimately, pressing is a blend of tactical discipline, physical effort, and mental focus. Strikers who master the art of pressing not only help their team defensively but also increase their value as complete players who contribute across all phases of the game.



Individual Training Session: Pressing Awareness







Setup:
Use a half-pitch with cones marking zones (central, wide, deep). One feeder acts as the opponent receiving the ball.



Execution:





Striker moves between zones, and on the coaches trigger, striker passes from to the coach.



The striker then applies pressure, aiming to cut off passing lanes and force predictable moves.  The coach can move zones with the ball.



Striker switches zones quickly to simulate defensive movement requirements.



Key Focus:
Awareness of pressing zones, body orientation, and blocking passing options.





Team Training Session: Pressing and Counter Pressing Game







Setup: The game setup is 2 separate teams, playing 2 different formations, in the highlighted zone



Execution:





The game always starts from a goalkeeper.  The team in possession must make 5 passes in the zone before they can exit the zone and try to score in the goal they are attacking. Once they attack the goal, the attacker has 7 seconds to score



Defenders are not allowed to follow a pass that exits the zone.



When an attacker (e.g. Blue Team) goes through on goal and is finished their attempt, a new ball is quickly played to the goalkeeper (e.g. Red Team) so the team has an overload. Attacker has to recover to the zone.



The defenders for the team in possession can drop out of the zone to receive passes (e.g. can go back to receive from the GK and/or drop to switch play), but only passes in the zone count towards the target



Progression 1: One team has to make 5 passes, and the other can attack the goal as soon as they win it (no minimum passes requirement)

Progression 2: One team only defends with 7 players, the front 3 don’t defend. As soon as the ball is won, the front 3 become involved again
