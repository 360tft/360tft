The Game Model




Welcome to the Youth Development Game Model Course

Thanks for being here. This course has been shaped by over 15 years of working with players at every level of the game, from grassroots to academy, and it's built on one simple idea:

Great coaching needs clarity and structure.

Right now, one of the biggest problems in youth football is the rise of disconnected training plans online. Coaches mean well, they download a session, tweak a few drills, and hope it fits their players. But too often, there's no clear thread that connects one session to the next, and no real way to know if the players are learning what they need to.

That's a big problem. Because learning isn't automatic, it's a battle against forgetting. Random drills won't win that battle.

This course gives you a model, a framework you can trust. It takes away the guesswork and replaces it with clarity: what to teach, when to teach it, and how to make sure it sticks. It's a methodical process that supports players at every stage of their development, building on what they've already learned.

Each stage builds essential competencies that unlock the next level of understanding, ensuring players develop genuine mastery rather than superficial skill.  Done right, this is like gold dust for both learning and long-term player development.

Inside, you'll find clearly defined stages that show what players should be able to do, technically and tactically, at each phase of their journey. These stages aren't just theory. They're practical, they're age-appropriate, and they're what I believe really matters. Everything else is just noise.





This isn't just about helping players execute skills. It's about helping them understand the why, when, and how so they can make better decisions in real game moments. It's also about helping you, the coach, build confidence that your players have actually grasped the concepts you're teaching. Because if you don't know what they know, how can you build on it?

Too many coaches are left guessing. They reference an idea in training and hope their players understand. This course replaces that hope with certainty so you know exactly what should be mastered, by whom, and when.

Thanks for committing to your own learning and for trusting me to be part of that journey.

Let's get started.

The Problem



The Problem
We all dream of developing footballers who go on to play in the Champions League or represent their country at the World Cup. But for most coaches, that's not the reality.

And that's okay, because that shouldn't be the only goal.

Our job as youth coaches should be simple: keep players in the game for as long as possible. Whether they go on to play, coach, or officiate, staying in the sport is a win. Football has so much to give, but too many kids are walking away from it too soon.

Just take a look at the image above.

You can see the confusion, the mixed messages, the pressure. One coach says "Don't lose the ball." Another says "Be brave and go for it." Parents are shouting instructions from the sidelines. Private coaches are saying something completely different. And stuck in the middle is a kid trying to make sense of it all.

It's no wonder they burn out. 

It's no wonder they feel like they're not good enough. 

It's no wonder they quit.

So how do we fix it?

We give players clarity. We give coaches consistency. And we create an age-appropriate blueprint that guides learning from the very first kick to the moment they're ready to compete.

This course is the blueprint.

It outlines exactly what players should be mastering at each age and stage of their development. It gives coaches a clear sense of purpose and direction so that no matter where a player is or who's coaching them, they're getting the right message.

We start with ball mastery. Because players who can't control the ball under pressure can't focus on the game around them. Each skill we develop becomes the foundation for the next level of understanding. We layer in decision-making. We build tactical awareness. And we finish with the complete picture of a confident, competent footballer ready to thrive in the game for life.

Let's give players the foundation they need to grow, enjoy, and stay in the game.

Enjoy the course.

What This Course Isn't



This course won't create the next Messi or guarantee your players will sign professional contracts. That's not what it's designed for, and that's not what youth football should be about.

This course is about something far more important: keeping players in the game.

Elite footballers represent less than 1% of all youth players. The other 99% deserve our attention too. They deserve coaching that respects their development, builds their confidence, and gives them the skills to enjoy football for life.

In truth, if we give players proper technical foundations and game understanding, they'll find their own level. Take that away, and they'll find other sports.

What we're really developing:
Future senior players who graduate from youth football still loving the game and wanting to play at their local club

Future coaches who understand the game because they learned it properly from the start

Future referees who know football inside out and want to give back

Future walking footballers who stay active and engaged with the sport into their later years

Football people who remain connected to the game in whatever capacity brings them joy

The reality is stark: too many players are walking away from football during their teenage years. They're being lost to the game permanently because their youth experience was confusing, pressurised, or simply didn't prepare them for what comes next.

This course exists to change that.
It provides an age and stage appropriate education that helps players graduate from youth football with the technical skills, game understanding, and confidence they need to transition successfully into senior football.

We're not trying to manufacture superstars. We're trying to develop complete footballers who can adapt, learn, and contribute at whatever level they choose to play.

Because the game needs all of them.
The Sunday league player who organises his team's training sessions. The parent who coaches her daughter's grassroots team with proper understanding. The referee who played the game and knows what players are thinking. The walking footballer who found the game again after years away.

These are the people who keep football alive in communities across the country. These are the people who matter.

And if we get the youth development right, if we give them the foundation they deserve, they'll stay in the game and make it better for the next generation.

That's what this course is for.

What This Course Isn't - The 360TFT Game Model · Football Coaching Academy

Your Tutor


Hi, I'm Kevin Middleton, founder of 360TFT and the coach behind this course.

Over the last 15 years, I've worked with players at just about every level of the game: grassroots kids kicking a ball for the first time, academy players fighting for deals, senior players trying to take the next step. I've coached in schools, academies, senior environments, and built one of the most coach-led football communities online.

Working across all these levels taught me that the best senior players were those who had solid technical foundations from childhood. The pathway from grassroots to senior football isn't about shortcuts, it's about building properly from the start.

And through all of that, one thing has stayed constant: Good players come from good environments.

Not necessarily flashy ones. Not always resource-rich ones. But clear, consistent, purposeful environments that make learning stick and let players grow.

Through building our online community, I've learned what coaches really struggle with: not knowing what to teach when, feeling overwhelmed by choice, and lacking confidence in their approach.

That's why I built this course. Not as a collection of drills. Not as a shortcut to winning. But as a structured, stage-appropriate model that helps coaches do what really matters, develop players for the long term.

If you're here, you're probably a coach who cares about doing it properly. You want your players to improve. You want them to enjoy the game. You want to know what to teach and when to teach it.

This course is here to help with that.

It's the blueprint I wish I'd had when I started coaching. It's been shaped by years on the pitch, real conversations with real coaches, and a relentless drive to do things better, for the player, and for the game.

Thanks for being here. Let's get to work.

— Kevin



How To Coach

Coaching isn't about running through drills and ticking boxes. It's about creating the conditions where learning sticks.

At youth level, especially, our job is to build technical fluency and decision-making through purposeful practice, not paint-by-numbers sessions where kids follow lines and rules and never learn to think. The aim isn't to make players predictable, it's to make them adaptable.

That means how you coach matters just as much as what you coach.



What Makes Coaching Effective?

Here's the approach we use across this course, and what we encourage all coaches to build into their practice:



Build Through Repetition But Mix It Up

Players don't learn from seeing something once. They learn from revisiting ideas over time, especially when the environment changes. You'll notice we return to key topics throughout 16-week blocks. That's intentional.





Repeat the same ideas across different practices



Change the constraints, space, or rules to keep players challenged



Revisit previously taught concepts regularly, not just once per block. We are not after coverage of topics, we are aiming for retention of knowledge.



Model First, Then Let Them Try

Young players benefit from clarity. Before they dive into an activity, show them what you're looking for.





Use live demos or slow-motion walkthroughs



Keep instructions simple: short phrases, one or two key points



If players aren't sure, show them again before stepping in with more words





Don't tell players everything. Guide them to think.





"What could you try next time?"



"Why did that work?"



"What would you do differently?"

Players who reflect, learn. Questions should nudge that process without becoming lectures.



Retrieval Over Review

Instead of re-teaching the same thing every week, use small moments to test what players remember.





"Who remembers what we worked on last time?"



"Show me the movement from last week's session."



"Can anyone demo the turn we did last session?"

When players retrieve knowledge, they're more likely to retain it long-term.









Set High Standards For Engagement

Fun doesn't mean chaos. A great session has both energy and purpose.





Start fast, keep things moving



Maximise ball-rolling time



Make sure every player knows what's expected of them behaviourally

Set boundaries early and hold players to them. It makes learning easier, and the session more enjoyable for everyone.



Coach In Context — “Moment, Slice, Situation”

Every session in this course connects to the game through a simple framework:





Moment: What part of the game are we in? (e.g. Building the Attack)



Slice: Where on the pitch is the action taking place? (e.g. Middle Third)



Situation: What's the context? (e.g. 1v1 Defending, or Playing With Back to Goal)

This gives your sessions purpose and your coaching clarity. When players learn a skill, they also learn when and where to use it.

This applies at younger ages as well, as they will play 1v1/2v2/3v3 etc. They will all face situations that apply to the game, even if you are coaching them in a different way.






Adapt To Age and Stage

Be realistic about what players can do at different ages.





Ages 1–6: Keep it fun, fast-paced, and about the ball. Technical repetition is your friend because automatic ball mastery creates the foundation for all future decision-making.



Ages 7–9: Start adding decision-making and awareness, but keep support high.



Ages 10–12: Start layering in bigger tactical ideas, but stay focused on clarity and repetition.

Remember: don't rush complexity. A player who can dribble past someone confidently is more valuable than a player who can describe a 4-3-3 formation but struggles 1v1. Players who struggle with basic skills under pressure can't access higher-level thinking. Master the foundation, unlock the potential.





Reading and Managing Group Energy

Effective coaches read their group's energy constantly and adjust accordingly. Energy management is as important as technical instruction.

High Energy Groups:





Channel energy into competitive activities



Use more intense, faster-paced exercises



Implement cooling-down periods with technical focus



Set clear boundaries early and maintain them consistently

Low Energy Groups:





Start with engaging warm-ups that build excitement



Use music or competitive elements to lift energy



Keep instructions brief and get them moving quickly



Introduce fun challenges and celebrations

Mixed Energy Groups:





Pair high-energy players with steady influences



Use activities that allow different energy levels to contribute



Rotate between calming and energising activities



Address individual energy needs within group activities



Maintaining Technical Quality Within Fun Activities

The challenge isn't choosing between fun and quality - it's achieving both simultaneously.

Quality Checkpoints:





Use brief 'pause and perfect' moments during activities



Celebrate good technique as enthusiastically as goals



Set technique challenges within games ("Can you use both feet in this game?")



Make quality execution part of the competition

Individual Coaching Within Group Flow:





Coach on the move - give feedback as you circulate



Use positive examples from one player to teach others



Pull players aside briefly for individual guidance without stopping the group



Use questions that help players self-correct




Why This Matters

This approach gives your players a consistent coaching voice, a clear framework, and a better chance of building long-term understanding. It stops the guesswork, keeps sessions development-focused, and helps your players fall in love with the game and stay in it for longer.

Let's get started.

How to Get the Most from This Course


This course isn't designed to be read once and shelved. It's a resource to work with, return to, and build from. You'll get the most value when you treat it the same way you'd want your players to treat their development, with consistency, reflection, and repetition.





Here’s how to approach it:



1. Work Through It in Order

The course is structured intentionally. Each section builds on what came before it. Jumping ahead is tempting, but to really understand how to develop players stage by stage, take your time and move through it in sequence.



2. Revisit Sections Often

Just like your players, you won't retain everything on the first go, and you're not supposed to. Come back to key topics as you coach. Read a section before a session. Retrieval makes learning stick.



3. Think Like a Teacher, Not a Technician

This isn't about running better drills. It's about coaching in a way that helps players understand and apply what they're learning. Ask yourself:





What is this player learning in this moment?



How does this link to what came before or what's coming next?



4. Apply What You Learn, One Layer at a Time

Don't overhaul everything at once. Start by applying one new idea per session, maybe it's how you structure a warm-up, or how you ask questions in an SSG. Layer your learning the same way players layer theirs.



5. Use the Community

Ask questions. Share challenges. Post wins. You'll learn more by engaging with other coaches than you will trying to figure everything out alone. This isn't just a course, it's a coaching community that's here to support your development too.



6. Remember What Success Looks Like

It's not about running the 'perfect session'. It's about building clarity. Helping players see the game more clearly. Helping them stay in the game longer. Success is a confident player who understands what they're doing and why.

If you approach the course the same way you want your players to approach their development, with curiosity, focus, and a willingness to learn from experience, you'll get everything you need from it.

Let's get started.

What If I Can't Do A Session?

Session Adaptation & Alternative Options

We've all been there. You arrive at training to discover different numbers, missing equipment, terrible weather, or players arriving at different times. Rather than panic, you adapt whilst maintaining your learning objectives.

The Art of Session Adaptation

Good coaches don't panic when plans change. They understand that the learning focus matters more than the exact format. Your job is to preserve the core skill or concept whilst adapting the delivery method to fit your reality.



Equipment & Space Adaptations

Missing Equipment:





Use existing pitch markings as boundaries



Create goals with cones, bags, or natural markers



Replace specialist equipment with basic alternatives



Focus on exercises that need minimal equipment

Limited Space:





Focus on close control and quick decision-making



Emphasise technical skills over running exercises



Use vertical rather than horizontal activities



Create multiple small areas rather than one large space



Group Size Challenges

Too Many Players (18+ when planned for 12):





Split into multiple groups doing the same activity



Run parallel sessions with rotation between stations



Create additional roles (servers, feeders, observers)



Use larger spaces divided into zones

Too Few Players (8 when planned for 16):





Reduce playing areas proportionally



Focus on technical repetition over tactical complexity



Use more 1v1 and 2v2 scenarios



Increase rest periods for higher intensity work



Weather & Indoor Contingencies

Adverse Weather:





Move ball mastery work under covered areas



Focus on close control exercises that require minimal space



Use gym halls for technical skills and small games



Emphasise core skills that transfer to any environment

Indoor Adaptations:





Prioritise ball mastery and passing combinations



Use wall passes for technical repetition



Focus on quick feet and tight control



Adapt finishing to smaller goals/targets



Attendance Variables

Late Arrivals:





Start with individual ball mastery that late players can join immediately



Use your warm-up phase as a rolling activity



Pair late arrivals with punctual players for quick integration



Keep core learning in the middle phases when everyone's present

Inconsistent Attendance:





Review previous week's focus in your warm-up



Use your reflection questions to check understanding



Allow regular attenders to help inconsistent ones



Focus on transferable skills that work regardless of group composition







The Sessions

A great session is more than cones and drills. It's a learning experience.

This section explains how to get the most out of the sessions in this course. While we provide the structure, the coaching still needs your voice, your eye, and your decision-making.

This isn't a copy-paste model. It's a flexible framework designed to ensure every session connects to the bigger picture and to what matters most: learning.



What Makes These Sessions Different

The sessions aren't standalone. They're not just warm-up, drill, game, go home. They're connected to a developmental model that progresses with the player:





Each session builds on the one before it



Each 16-week block introduces or revisits essential topics



Each session aligns to the Moment, Slice, Situation framework

This means players aren't just 'busy', they're learning how to make better decisions in context.



Our Framework: Moment – Slice – Situation



Every session is guided by a three-part lens:

1. Moment: Where are we in the game? Are we attacking? Defending? Transitioning?

Examples:





Building the Attack



Defending in the Final Third



Creating the Attack



Chasing the Game

2. Slice: What part of the pitch are we in?

Examples:





Defensive Third



Middle Third



Final Third

3. Situation: What's happening? Are we underloaded? In a 1v1?

Examples:





Opponent face-to-face



2v1 attacking overload



Recovery run from behind



Playing with back to goal

This model helps you frame why you're coaching something, where it applies, and when it should be used. It also helps players recognise these moments as they happen, which is how real learning sticks.









Use the Sessions with Flexibility But Purpose

Each session plan comes with a clear focus. But it's not a script, it's a toolkit.

Coaches are encouraged to:





Adapt to the number of players you have



Modify constraints (space, time, overloads)



Dial up or down complexity based on player understanding



Change the environment while staying on the same learning focus

The goal isn't to make the session look 'perfect', it's to create conditions where the learning is real, game-like, and repeated.



Repetition Isn't Boring, It's Where Learning Lives

We don't move on from a practice just because players start to get it, we lean into it.

When a session focuses on a key action or concept, repeating it isn't wasted time, it's targeted investment.

Each time players return to a familiar structure, they:





See the game quicker



Act with more confidence



Build stronger mental models

What looks like repetition is actually refinement. Great players recognise patterns and respond earlier than others. That intelligence comes from deliberate, focused, repeated exposure to key football problems.



How This Applies at Different Age Groups

While the session structure remains consistent across the course, the intent, intensity, and complexity evolve as players grow.



🔹 Master The Ball (0–11 Years Old)

Focus:





Ball contact, rhythm, and confidence



Using both feet, staying on the ball, exploring freely

Environment:





Short bursts of activity



High ball engagement



Minimal standing around

Sessions look like:





Obstacle courses



Dribbling races



Tag games with a technical focus

Coach role:





Encourage exploration



Repeat key actions



Use simple language



Celebrate effort and discovery



Don't expect decision-making fluency, focus on building fluency with the ball and body.



🔸 Master The Opponent (7–12 Years Old)

Focus:





1v1s, small group play, decision-making under pressure



Combining technical skill with tactical awareness

Environment:





Ball mastery in context



Small-sided games



Challenges, constraints, and lots of touches

Sessions look like:





Game-based learning



Decision-driven practices



Technical repetition with opponents involved

Coach role:





Start shaping decisions



Model outcomes



Ask questions to prompt reflection



Revisit key scenarios often



Expect mistakes, that’s part of learning how to outplay opponents.



⚫ Master The Game (11–18 Years Old)

Focus:





Tactical understanding and team concepts



Adapting technique within game situations

Environment:





Scenario-based



More structured roles



Deeper challenge through constraints

Sessions look like:





Functional SSGs



Rotating positional tasks



Tactical walkthroughs with game tempo

Coach role:





Tie every practice back to game moments



Ask for why, not just what



Keep clarity,  one or two ideas per session



This is where players start thinking like players, not just participants.



⚫ Master The Position (15–21 Years Old)

Focus:





Individual responsibilities in and out of possession



Position-specific actions and understanding

Environment:





Match-realistic zones and transitions



Constraints by position, shape, and roles

Sessions look like:





Functional training



Repetitions in context



Phase-of-play work

Coach role:





Clarify expectations for each role



Make decisions visual and repeatable



Push consistency under pressure



The goal here is tactical maturity, not technical basics.



⚫ Master The Performance (17–21 Years Old)

Focus:





Match demands, psychological readiness, game management

Environment:





High-stakes simulation



Scenario-led sessions



Peer feedback and reflection

Sessions look like:





Match-prep walkthroughs



In-game scenario problem solving



Live coaching in real context

Coach role:





Step back, observe learning



Use fewer words, more questions



Let players struggle and reflect



Performance is about making the right choices when it matters most.



Final Thought

Every session is a chance to build a thread. That thread connects learning from week to week and helps players grow into confident decision-makers on the pitch.

Your job isn't to run the session.

It's to create the conditions for players to learn the game and love the game.

With this in mind, here are some recommended pitch sizes per age group and exercises to help them have enough space to play and explore.

Session Success Indicators





This course will be broken down into different mastery levels that cut across age groups, so when should you progress players from one level to the next?

Well, knowing when players are ready to progress isn't guesswork. It's about recognising clear competency markers that show genuine mastery, not just participation.

These indicators help you make informed decisions about when to increase complexity, when to revisit foundations, and when players are truly ready for the next developmental stage.



Your Role as Coach

Just a quick disclaimer.

The below content is intended to be helpful, but please use your judgment as a coach. Be flexible. You’re not expected to teach all players the same thing at the same time; you're expected to coach the player in front of you.





If a session from Master The Ball fits your 12-year-olds this week, run it.



If your 10-year-olds are flying and need more decision-based work, challenge them.

Let's dive into the session success factors for each age group.



The 80% Rule

Players should demonstrate 80% success rate on current level indicators before progressing to the next stage. This isn't about perfection, it's about building genuine competence that can handle increased pressure and complexity.

Competence creates confidence. Confidence enables learning.

Master The Ball (0–11 Years Old)

Success Indicators (examples):





Players can dribble 20 metres without losing control



Comfortable using both feet to change direction



Can juggle the ball 5+ times consistently



Shows excitement when given a ball, not fear



Attempts skills even when defenders approach

What This Means: At this stage, the ball should feel like an extension of the player's body. They're not thinking about technique, they're exploring possibilities. Players who demonstrate these indicators have built the foundation for all future learning.

Red Flags:





Avoids using weaker foot under any pressure



Stops dribbling when opponents get close



Can only perform skills when stationary



Shows frustration or fear when ball control breaks down

Master The Opponent (7–12 Years Old)

Success Indicators (examples):





Wins 6 out of 10 opposed 1v1s



Makes deliberate skill choices (not random moves)



Can explain why they chose a particular action



Seeks out 1v1 opportunities instead of avoiding them



Adapts technique when space or pressure changes

What This Means: Players at this level understand that technique serves a purpose. They're beginning to read opponents and make decisions based on what they see, not what they've memorised. The shift from ball mastery to opponent mastery is happening.

Red Flags:





Uses the same move regardless of situation



Can't explain their decision-making



Avoids 1v1 situations when possible



Technique breaks down immediately under pressure

Master The Game (11–18 Years Old)

Success Indicators:





Recognises game moments before they're coached



Can play two different positions effectively



Starts to explain tactical decisions using game context



Anticipates opponents' actions, not just reacting



Maintains technique quality under time pressure

What This Means: Game intelligence is emerging. Players understand not just what to do and when, but why tactical decisions matter. They're connecting individual actions to team success and can adapt their role based on game demands.

Red Flags:





Only performs well in familiar positions



Needs constant coaching to recognise patterns



Cannot maintain standards when game tempo increases



Focuses only on individual success, not team outcomes

Using These Indicators

These markers aren't rigid checkpoints, they're flexible guides that help you understand where players truly are in their development. Use them to:





Plan appropriate challenges: Don't rush complexity until foundations are solid



Identify skill gaps: Address weaknesses before they become permanent limitations



Build confidence: Ensure players experience success at each level



Make progression decisions: Move forward based on competence, not just age or time spent

Remember: A player who demonstrates genuine competence at one level will thrive when challenged at the next. A player who's rushed forward without solid foundations will struggle and lose confidence.

Trust the process. Respect the progression. Build players who love the game.

The 16-Week Structure



If we want players to learn deeply, we must teach intentionally.

This course follows a repeating 16-week model, not because it fits neatly into a term or a season, but because it creates a structured learning environment built around long-term retention, technical growth, and game understanding.

The structure works. But how you use it is what makes the difference.



Why a 16-Week Plan Works

You don't need 100 drills to develop players. You need a clear plan and the discipline to revisit what matters most.

A 16-week block works when it:





Spirals topics (return to them often, in different forms)



Builds depth, not just coverage



Encourages retrieval (recalling old learning strengthens memory)



Stresses transfer, not just execution (can they do it in a game?)



“But didn’t we already do this?”
Yes,and we’re doing it again, on purpose.

Revisiting topics is not failure. In fact, forgetting is part of the learning process. When players retrieve and reapply something they've learned before, especially in a slightly new form, that learning becomes stronger and more durable.

This is how we develop decision-makers, not just drill repeaters.



Training Twice a Week? Move to the Next Session

If your team trains twice a week, don't repeat the same session. Move to the next one in the sequence.

This means you'll complete the 16-session curriculum in 8 weeks instead of 16. This is perfectly fine because the learning principles remain the same:





Players still get progressive skill development



Each session builds on the previous one



The spiral learning approach still applies when you restart the cycle

The key is maintaining the session order and progression, regardless of how quickly you move through it.



How the Core Topics Fit In

Throughout this course, you'll see references to specific Core Topics.

These are the technical, tactical, and physical building blocks we want players to return to again and again, not in isolation, but in meaningful, match-relevant ways.

You'll see them show up in your 16-week plans, your small-sided games, and your player challenges, each time with a new level of complexity, realism, or decision-making.

Core Topics don't get "ticked off."

They get layered and refined through experience, pressure, and feedback.

This is where the Moment, Slice, Situation framework plays its part.

We don't just coach techniques. We coach where and when they matter in the game.









Structure by Age Group

The 16-week model flexes depending on the age and stage of the players. Here's how the structure evolves across development phases:

🔹 Ages 1–6:

Master the Ball Foundations





Introduce basic ball contact and movement skills



Build rhythm, coordination, and love for the ball



Prioritise fun, exploration, and expression



Minimal pressure, maximum touches



🔹 Ages 7–12:

Master the Opponent





Introduce pressure, 1v1 decisions, and physical duels



Begin combining technical actions with game context



Introduce the concept of slices and moments (middle third, attacking third, etc.)



Revisit 1–6 topics with greater complexity and intent



🔹 Ages 11–18:

Master the Game





Expand focus to game understanding: in-possession, out-of-possession, transition



Add scanning, pattern recognition, and tactical shape



Use full-pitch decision-making to build context



Prepare for system flexibility and match constraints



🔹 Ages 15–21:

Master the Position





Layer in position-specific responsibilities



Develop tactical discipline within roles



Zoom in on the "when" and "why" of technical choices



Start shaping player identity (e.g., "I'm a left-footed centre-back who can build and break")



🔹 Ages 17–21:

Master the Performance





Manage fatigue, pressure, and expectation



Use mental, tactical, and physical stressors to stretch performance



Apply game intelligence under competition demands



Prepare for high-stakes environments



A Simple, Spiralling Breakdown

Here's how a single 16-week cycle can be structured:

Weeks 1–8: First Exposure





Introduce key technical skills



Build confidence, coordination, and comfort



Focus on reps, challenge, and fun

Weeks 9–16: Reinforcement & Transfer





Revisit the same topics with more game pressure



Add decisions, constraints, and opponents



Focus on clarity, decision-making, and game application



One cycle lays the foundation.
The next cycle strengthens it.
Future cycles elevate it.



Weekly Structure Example

Every week should include:

🔧 Core Skill Focus: A specific technical action or micro-skill (e.g. turns, receiving, inside-outside dribble) 

📍 Contextual Game Scenario: Match-related challenge (e.g. 1v1 vs side pressure, movement to create space) 

⚽ Small Sided Game (SSG): Use a rule tweak or condition to draw out that week's skill focus in a game 

🥅 Match-Related Play: Free play with minimal constraints, a chance for players to try what they’ve learned

🧠 Reflection & Reinforcement: Use questions or a quick review to link back to previous weeks









Troubleshooting: What If Players Aren't Retaining Skills Between Cycles?

If players seem to have forgotten skills when you return to them, don't panic. This is normal and fixable.

Check These First:





Complexity overload: Were you trying to teach too much at once? Strip back to one key element per session.



Insufficient repetition: Most players need 8-12 quality repetitions of a skill before it starts to stick.



Missing context: Skills learned in isolation don't transfer. Always connect technique to game situations.



Wrong developmental stage: Are you teaching 11-year-old concepts to 8-year-olds? Match the complexity to the player's capacity.

Quick Fixes:





Extend the cycle: Instead of 16 weeks, run 20-24 weeks for younger players who need more time.



Increase frequency: Add 5-minute skill sessions at the start of every training.



Simplify first: Go back to easier versions before adding pressure or complexity.



Check individual readiness: Some players may need individual support to catch up with group level.

Remember: Forgetting is part of learning. Each time players retrieve a skill they thought they'd lost, they strengthen the neural pathway. What feels like going backwards is actually building forwards.







Why This Model Matters

If the goal is to help players retain, recall, and apply, we must coach with that in mind.





Learning doesn't stick after one try



Randomness confuses, structure clarifies



Drills are not the outcome, transfer is

Our sessions are built to loop back. Each time a player repeats something, they deepen the mental model behind it.

This is how you grow footballers who read the game, not just run drills. Technical skills without game context create players who perform in training but struggle in matches.



Final Thought



Great coaching doesn’t race ahead, it circles back.

This 16-week structure gives you a plan. The sessions give you the tools. Your coaching brings the learning to life.

Let's get started.

How to Navigate The Overlapping Age Groups



As you work through this course, you'll notice that the age bands across the five Mastery Stages aren't rigid. There's overlap, and that's by design.

You might ask:



“If one section goes up to age 11, and the next starts at 7… which one should I use?”

That’s a good question. The answer lies in how you understand development.



Development Doesn’t Happen in Straight Lines

Some players develop early. Others take more time.

Some pick up concepts quickly but need longer to refine their technique. Others look sharp technically but struggle with game understanding under pressure.

That's why this course isn't designed around birth years, it's designed around developmental readiness.



Players don’t stop mastering the ball because they’ve turned 11.
And they won’t become game experts just because they’ve turned 13.

Think in Terms of Foundation and Challenge

Each overlapping age range serves a specific purpose:

The Foundation Stage represents what players should be comfortable with before moving forward. This is their base level of competence.

The Challenge Stage represents the new learning they're ready to tackle whilst maintaining their foundation skills.

Take a 10-year-old, for example:





Foundation: They should be mastering ball skills (Master The Ball focus)



Challenge: They can begin learning opponent-focused concepts (Master The Opponent introduction)

This doesn't mean abandoning ball work when they turn 10. It means layering opponent-focused challenges on top of their established ball mastery.



The Practical Application

For players in the overlap zones, use both stages strategically:

Ages 7-11 (Master The Ball + Master The Opponent Overlap)





60% of training time: Continue reinforcing ball mastery, rhythm, and technical confidence



40% of training time: Introduce simple 1v1 concepts, basic decision-making, light pressure

Ages 11-15 (Master The Opponent + Master The Game Overlap)





60% of training time: Focus on 1v1 skills, small group play, individual decision-making



40% of training time: Begin introducing team concepts, positional awareness, tactical understanding

Ages 15-18 (Master The Game + Master The Position Overlap)





60% of training time: Develop tactical understanding, team play, game intelligence



40% of training time: Begin position-specific work, role clarity, tactical responsibility



Use Development, Not Just Age

Rather than asking: "How old is this player?" Ask: "What foundation do they have, and what challenge are they ready for?"

Examples:





A technically confident 8-year-old who loves 1v1s → Increase their Master The Opponent percentage



A 12-year-old who still struggles with basic ball skills → Maintain higher Master The Ball percentage



A 16-year-old who dominates 1v1s but doesn't understand positioning → Focus more on Master The Game concepts





Weekly Planning for Overlap Ages

For players in overlap zones training twice weekly:

Session 1: Focus on their foundation stage (reinforcing established skills) Session 2: Focus on their challenge stage (introducing new concepts)

This ensures continuous development in both areas without overwhelming players or abandoning previously learned skills.

The Flexibility Principle

The overlap exists so you can coach the player, not the age. You're not locked into rigid categories. You're using the right developmental focus for the right moment.

Some weeks, your 11-year-olds might need more ball mastery work. Other weeks, they might be ready for tactical challenges. The model adapts to player readiness, not calendar dates.

Your Role as Coach

Use your professional judgement. Observe your players. Understand where they are, not just how old they are.





If players are struggling with foundation skills, spend more time there



If players have mastered their foundation, increase the challenge



If players seem overwhelmed, step back to previous stage concepts



If players seem bored, introduce next stage elements

The model serves the player, not the other way around.

This flexibility is what makes long-term development possible. Players progress when they're ready, not when the calendar says they should.
