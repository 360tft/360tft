                    I enjoyed Kevin's sessions a lot — they were <strong>position specific</strong> which allowed you to improve on areas you needed to and were always of <strong>high quality and intensity</strong>. <strong>Since Kev joined Arbroath I've seen an increase in my confidence on game days</strong>, playing out the back, decision making and positioning. Would definitely recommend.

Kevin is very approachable and <strong>happy to share his knowledge</strong> with anyone who asks.

                    I had the privilege of doing extra training sessions with Kevin during my time with Arbroath FC. The precision striker drills were <strong>challenging, but match realistic</strong>. <strong>This is all a player can ask for when they are looking to improve their game</strong>.
