                <p>After {{ site.site_constants.years_experience }} years of coaching at every level, I've cracked the code on what actually develops players. Not just drills that look good, but systems that create confident, capable footballers who perform when it matters.</p>
                
                <p>My journey began with failure. Fresh-faced and eager, I thought coaching was about knowing more drills than the next person. I was wrong. My first season coaching an U12 team was humbling - despite endless energy and what I thought were great sessions, the players weren't improving.</p>
                
                <p>That failure became my foundation. The result? The 360TFT Game Model - a systematic approach to developing complete players.</p>
