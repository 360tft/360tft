                <p>After {{ site.site_constants.years_experience }} years of coaching at every level, I've cracked the code on what actually develops players. Not just drills that look good, but systems that create confident, capable footballers who perform when it matters.</p>
                <p>The 360TFT Game Model isn't theory, it's battle-tested with thousands of players across grassroots to academy level. Every session plan, every coaching principle, every development pathway has been refined through real-world results.</p>
                <p>I've helped over {{ site.site_constants.coaches_mentored }} coaches transform their teams, and now I want to help you do the same.</p>
