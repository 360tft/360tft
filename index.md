                <h2>Meet Kevin Middleton - The Coaching Problem Solver</h2>
                <p><strong>I used to be the coach running random sessions, hoping something would work.</strong></p>
                
                <p>My first season coaching U12s was humbling. Despite endless energy and what I thought were great sessions, the players weren't improving. Parents were polite but concerned. I was failing the kids who trusted me.</p>
                
                <p>That's when I realised: <strong>coaching isn't about knowing more drills, it's about diagnosing problems systematically, then fixing them with targeted solutions.</strong></p>
                
                <p>After {{ site.site_constants.years_experience }} years refining this approach across grassroots to professional level (including work with Arbroath FC professionals), I've helped {{ site.site_constants.coaches_mentored }} coaches transform from overwhelmed to confident through the 360TFT Coaching Triage method.</p>
