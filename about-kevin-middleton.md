                    <h2>The Early Days</h2>
                    <p>My coaching journey began like many others - with passion, but little direction. Fresh-faced and eager, I thought coaching was about knowing more drills than the next person. I was wrong.</p>
                    
                    <p>My first season coaching an U12 team was humbling. Despite having endless energy and what I thought were great sessions, the players weren't improving. Parents were polite but concerned. I was failing the kids who trusted me to help them get better.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        That's when I realized coaching isn't about what you know - it's about how effectively you can transfer that knowledge into improved player performance.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>I spent that summer studying everything I could find about player development, sports psychology, and motor learning. But more importantly, I started watching my players more carefully - not just what they were doing wrong, but why they were doing it wrong.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-section" id="coaching-evolution">
                    <h2>The Coaching Evolution</h2>
                    <p>Over the next few years, I coached at every level - grassroots clubs, local academies, school teams. Each environment taught me something different about how players learn and develop.</p>

                    <h2>The Birth of 360TFT</h2>
                    <p>The "360" represents the complete player - technical, tactical, physical, and mental development all working together. "TFT" stands for "Think Fast, Think Football" - the ability to make good decisions under pressure.</p>
                    
                    <p>But 360TFT became more than a methodology. It became a community of coaches who believe that every player deserves systematic, purposeful development. Not just the talented ones. Not just the ones whose parents can afford private coaching. Every player.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        The moment I realized 360TFT was working was when a parent coach told me: "My son doesn't just play better now - he thinks about the game differently." That's when I knew we were onto something special.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>Word spread through coaching networks. Other coaches started asking for my session plans, my development frameworks, my "secrets." But I realized that giving someone a drill isn't the same as teaching them how to coach. That's when I decided to build something bigger.</p>

                <div class="story-section" id="philosophy">
                    <h2>My Coaching Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>After {{ page.years_experience }} years of coaching, certain principles have become non-negotiable for me. These aren't just theories - they're battle-tested truths that separate coaches who develop players from coaches who just run training sessions.</p>

                    <h2>Today & What's Next</h2>
                    <p>Today, 360TFT has grown beyond what I ever imagined. We have coaches using our methodologies in professional academies, grassroots clubs, and school programs across six continents. The community includes parent coaches taking their first steps and experienced professionals refining their craft.</p>
                    
                    <p>But I'm not done. The Football Coaching Academy represents the next evolution - a place where serious coaches can access cutting-edge research, learn from each other, and stay ahead of the curve in player development.</p>
                    
                    <p>My mission remains the same: to help coaches develop better players, faster. Because when coaches improve, players improve. And when players improve, the beautiful game gets even more beautiful.</p>
