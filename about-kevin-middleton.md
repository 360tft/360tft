                <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
                <p>Like most coaches, my journey started as a player who loved the game but wasn't the most naturally gifted. I spent countless hours trying to improve, often frustrated by my own limitations and confused by coaching that seemed to work for some players but not others.</p>
                
                <p>This early experience taught me something crucial: not every player learns the same way, and not every coaching method works for every player. That realisation would later become the foundation of everything I do.</p>
                
                <p>When my playing days ended, I knew I wanted to stay in football. But instead of just copying what I'd experienced as a player, I became obsessed with understanding how players actually develop. I read everything I could find about motor learning, sports psychology, and pedagogical approaches to coaching.</p>

                <h2>The Coaching Journey</h2>
                <p>I started coaching grassroots football, working with kids who just wanted to have fun and parents who wanted their children to improve. It was here that I learned my most valuable lessons about player development.</p>
                
                <p>Every age group taught me something different. With the youngest players, I discovered that technique development happens faster when it's disguised as play. With teenagers, I learned that confidence and competence develop together, not separately. With adults, I found that understanding the 'why' behind exercises dramatically improves engagement and retention.</p>
                
                <p>Over {{ site.site_constants.years_experience }} years, I've coached at every level - from complete beginners taking their first touches to academy players preparing for professional contracts. Each experience added another piece to the puzzle of how players really develop.</p>

                <h2>The 360TFT Methodology Foundation</h2>
                <p>After years of coaching different ages and abilities, I systematized what I call the 360TFT methodology. This framework is built on three core principles that transform how coaches develop players:</p>

                            <h3>Systematic Development</h3>
                            <p>Players develop fastest when their training follows a logical, progressive system. Random drills create random results. Systematic training creates systematic improvement.</p>

                            <p>You can't just tell players to be confident - you have to give them reasons to be confident. When players master skills progressively, confidence becomes a natural byproduct.</p>

                <h2>Building 360TFT</h2>
                <p>360TFT started as a solution to a problem I kept seeing: great coaches struggling with the same challenges I'd faced. They wanted to help their players improve but didn't have a systematic approach to player development.</p>
                
                <p>I began sharing my session plans and methodologies with other coaches. What started as informal help quickly grew into something bigger. Coaches were getting remarkable results using these systems, and word spread quickly through the football community.</p>
                
                <p>Today, 360TFT has grown into a global community of {{ site.site_constants.coaches_mentored }} coaches who've developed {{ site.site_constants.players_developed }} players using these methodologies. From grassroots clubs in small towns to professional academies in major cities, coaches are using the 360TFT Game Model to transform how they develop players.</p>
                
                <p>The community includes parent coaches taking their first steps and experienced professionals refining their craft.</p>
                
                <p>But I'm not done. The Football Coaching Academy represents the next evolution - a place where serious coaches can access cutting-edge research, learn from each other, and stay ahead of the curve in player development.</p>
                
                <p>My mission remains the same: to help coaches develop better players, faster. Because when coaches improve, players improve. And when players improve, the beautiful game gets even more beautiful.</p>
